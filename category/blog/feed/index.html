<p>In September, 2020 the Digital Public Goods Alliance Financial Inclusion Community of Practice (CoP) engaged in a thoughtful, virtual discussion about the relationship between digital public infrastructures (DPIs) and digital public goods (DPGs). In this <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/DPGA-Paper_Accelerating_Financial_Inclusion.pdf">paper,</a> we document our progress in defining what that intersection is, and how to identify it. In this post we share more about the community of practice model, how it led to our exploration of digital public goods that are also foundational digital public infrastructures, and what the next steps are for the Financial Inclusion CoP. </p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/DPGA-Paper_Accelerating_Financial_Inclusion.pdf"><strong>Read the full paper</strong></a></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>The DPGA Community of Practice Model</strong></p>



<p>The DPGA convenes expert Communities of Practice (CoPs) to support the discovery, assessment and advancement of digital public goods with high potential for addressing critical development needs in low- and middle-income countries. Currently, there are ongoing CoPs for climate change adaptation, digital health, and financial inclusion. Within these broad topics, each CoP narrows in on particular focus areas by considering relevance and potential impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Digitalisation, financial inclusion and COVID-19</strong></p>



<p>The last years have seen growing international consensus around the need to accelerate digitalisation of public financing as a driver of financial inclusion and the broader 2030-agenda. The value of digitalising government payments in developing countries is estimated at US$220-$320 billion annually by the IMF. </p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated this need, as governments with robust systems in place were better equipped to respond to the outbreak not only in their direct health response, but also by targeting vulnerable populations and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/590531592231143435/pdf/Social-Protection-and-Jobs-Responses-to-COVID-19-A-Real-Time-Review-of-Country-Measures-June-12-2020.pdf" target="_blank">delivering payments</a> into people’s accounts to mitigate the economic hardships caused by the outbreak.</p>



<p>The Financial Inclusion CoP has therefore spent the last few months working to identify and shortlist technologies that, in a given country, can be used by a range of service providers and innovators. These technologies can be built on across sectors and have features that can allow countries to freely adopt and iterate them to meet local needs. Projects that were at this particular intersection of digital public goods (DPGs) and digital public infrastructures (DPIs) stood out as meeting all of these criteria.</p>



<p>Below, we share a snapshot of our thinking, but encourage you to <a href="http://bit.ly/DPGAFinancialInclusion">read the full paper</a> for more detail.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Defining digital public goods and digital public infrastructures</strong></p>



<p>Digital public goods are defined by the UN Secretary-General’s <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a> as “<em>open-source software, open data, open artificial intelligence models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable international and domestic laws, standards and best practices and do no harm</em>.” Encompassing the UN’s shared goals, DPGs should also be relevant for attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no similarly authoritative definition of DPIs, but they are often referred to as<em> the rails that other solutions “run on top of</em>” and their implementation typically enables many other solutions and business models to flourish. It is furthermore meaningful to divide them into foundational and functional categories, referring to<em> the extent to which</em> they are horizontal enablers.</p>



<p><strong>Narrowing in on the DPIs that can drive financial inclusion at scale&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Discussions within the CoP on which technologies could have the most potential impact on financial inclusion and would be most horizontally enabling led to an initial shortlist of technologies for further assessment.</p>



<p>The DPGA Secretariat is now in the final stages of verifying these technologies against <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">the 9-criteria open standard</a> that the Alliance has developed to operationalise the definition of DPGs. Key transformative features of DPGs include their adoptability and adaptability, and their resulting potential to help form new models for international digital cooperation. DPGs can be foundations for multi-stakeholder cooperation and can help transcend geographical, institutional, sectoral and expertise boundaries. Local adaptations and iterations can be shared back with the core project and help ensure long term sustainability. DPGs can also help safeguard human rights through relevant minimum standards and through providing transparency and accountability around how technologies have been designed.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10125334/UNI232736.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-648"/><figcaption>© UNICEF/UN0216637/Frank Dejongh</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Of particular importance for driving financial inclusion at scale is that, due to their open source licensing, DPGs can offer more control and independence and reduce the risk of vendor lock-in, making it easier for countries to make strategic decisions and have a long-term and holistic perspective when building out their digital foundations. </p>



<p><strong>The shortlist</strong></p>



<p>The table below depicts key features of digital public goods compared to digital public infrastructures and shows the technologies (highlighted section) that have been identified by the CoP as both foundational DPIs <em>and </em>likely<em> </em>DPGs.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><br></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong><em>Proprietary</em></strong><br><em>Cannot be freely adopted or adapted</em></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong><em>Open Source</em></strong><br><em>Can be freely adopted or adapted&nbsp;</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>Functional</em></strong><em><br></em><em>Enablers of public service delivery and of building out additional services in one or a few sectors</em></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>DPI</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>DPI, DPG</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>Foundational</em></strong><em> </em><em>Backbones of public service delivery across all sectors, that solve problems impacting the state, market and consumers&nbsp;</em></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>DPI</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>DPI, DPG </strong><br><strong><mark>*Focus area for the CoP</mark></strong><br><br>Shortlisted technologies in the final stages of DPG Standard verification: <em>MOSIP, Mojaloop, X-Road, OpenCRVS, Mifos, Apache Fineract, OpenG2P</em></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>



<p>Once DPG Standard compliance is verified, the DPGA Secretariat will work with the CoP to conduct a deeper assessment of these technologies in order to compile and highlight information of key relevance to governments, donors and other stakeholders working to accelerate financial inclusion through digitalisation.&nbsp; <br></p>



<p>Also, the transformative potential of DPGs can not be fully realized unless we simultaneously transform the systems, structures and practices in which these technologies are embedded. As one important step in this direction, the DPGA Secretariat is therefore working with philanthropic and government donors to align on a common global approach to resource mobilisation and coordination.<br></p>

<p>Yesterday, DPGA Co-Founder UNICEF published <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/unicefs-open-source-approach-innovation">this article</a> outlining UNICEF&#8217;s various tools and platforms that operationalise its commitment to open source. </p>



<p>Please find an excerpt below. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children and believes that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support the realization of children’s rights are critical to improving their lives.</p>



<p>As recognised in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">UN Secretary-General&#8217;s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation Report</a> in June 2020,&nbsp; digital public goods &#8211; defined as “open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content” have a critical role in accelerating achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>



<p>UNICEF along with the Governments of Norway and Sierra Leone, and the India-based think tank iSPIRT have jointly established the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>, a multi-stakeholder initiative to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods. The DPGA is an effort to convene a network of partners from different sectors that will contribute to the identification, support, scale-up, and use of software, data, and algorithms that can advance humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As partners explore and scale efforts on digital public goods, UNICEF is sharing its experience in setting up operational processes and tools to support and build open source across all of it’s work.</p>

<p><strong>UNICEF&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>UNICEF is a proud co-lead of the UN Secretary General’s <a href="https://digitalcooperation.org/">The Age of Digital Interdependence</a> recommendations around universal connectivity (1A) and digital public goods (1B).</p>



<p>UNICEF co-founded the Digital Public Goods Alliance as a result of recommendation 1B’s call for a “broad multi-stakeholder alliance, involving the UN, to create a platform for sharing digital public goods”. This work aims to make open source solutions more accessible to governments and to help them scale. UNICEF and other DPGA partners are working directly with national governments, UN agencies, and others who are looking for open source solutions to deploy in their countries.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>UNICEF brings a track record of sourcing, investing in, and supporting open source solutions to the DPGA. They do so through the <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/venturefund">UNICEF Venture Fund</a> which provides start-ups in developing and emerging markets with equity-free seed funding. They’ve also done cutting edge work that leverages blockchain technology to provide <a href="https://cryptofund.unicef.io/">investments in cryptocurrency</a>, creating <strong>innovative financing models</strong> that <strong>incentivise and encourage the creation</strong> of open-source digital public goods. Finally, UNICEF has been a leader within the DPGA in identifying and connecting with <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">Pathfinder countries</a> and leveraging their experience incentivizing positive grassroots impacts through <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/Boost">digital tokens</a>.<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/26112819/Screenshot_2020-10-20-UNICEF-Venture-Fund.png" alt="" class="wp-image-624"/><figcaption>https://www.unicef.org/innovation/venturefund</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>UNICEF is actively working to address underlying barriers that currently limit access to digital public goods. UNICEF’s <a href="http://gigaconnect.org/">Giga project</a>, anchored in recommendation 1A, sets the goal of providing connectivity to every school in the world and every young person with information, opportunity and choice &#8211; including through increased access to DPGs. According to the ITU, some 3.6 billion people in the world do not have access to the internet. That lack of access means exclusion, fewer resources to learn and to grow, and limited opportunities for the most vulnerable children and youth to fulfill their potential. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Each member of the current Interim Strategy Group (ISG) — consisting of iSPIRT, Norway, Sierra Leone and UNICEF — brings their own areas of expertise and interest to the DPGA which makes it stronger and more diverse in its reach and potential impact. As the DPGA is built out over time, membership will expand and change to include more stakeholders.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a> &#8212; an initiative co-founded by iSPIRT, Sierra Leone, The Government of Norway and UNICEF &#8212; has been working to identify, support and promote digital public goods to implement recommendation 1B from the <a href="https://digitalcooperation.org/">June 2019 Report of the UN Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation</a>. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sierra Leone&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>&nbsp;Sierra Leone’s Directorate of Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (DSTI) has highlighted how youth empowerment, economic reform and health infrastructure can open up regional possibilities. Like iSPIRT, Sierra Leone is leading by example, creating a virtuous cycle driven by their four pillars (Data for Decision Making, Service Delivery &amp; Citizen Engagement, Data Systems &amp; Technology Design, and Ecosystem Strengthening) that serve as a foundation to turn Sierra Leone into an innovation and entrepreneurship hub, that other developing countries can emulate.&nbsp;<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>The DSTI in particular is playing a key role by engaging private sector and university communities to help build the technology that makes the implementation of digital public goods possible. This comes from an understanding that, in order for DPGs to evolve at scale and with a lower barrier to entry, there needs to be a supportive ecosystem built up that addresses questions of resourcing and intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sierra Leone is also <a href="https://www.dsti.gov.sl/sierra-leone-national-innovation-digital-strategy-2019-2029">setting an example</a> by documenting their progress and lessons learned.

<p><strong>NEW: Follow the Digital Public Goods Alliance on Twitter</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/DPGAlliance"> @DPGAlliance</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Last week we kicked off a four part series. </strong>In each part, we will share exciting work from one of the Co-Founders of the Digital Public Goods Alliance. This week we’re featuring Norway.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-1-meet-our-co-founders-ispirt-61f1f41d6642" target="_blank">If you missed Part 1 on iSPIRT last week, you can see it here.</a></p>



<p>As we said last week, one of the fundamental strengths of the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) is its decentralized, yet coordinated structure. Each member of the current Interim Strategy Group (ISG) &#8211; consisting of iSPIRT, Norway, Sierra Leone and UNICEF &#8211; brings their own areas of expertise and interest to the DPGA which makes it stronger and more diverse in its reach and potential impact. As the DPGA is built out over time, membership will expand and change to include more stakeholders.&nbsp;In this four part series, we’re pleased to offer a snapshot of the exciting work being led by each of the current ISG members. <strong>This week we focus on Norway.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Norway</strong></h4>



<p>Norway believes in the deployment of digital public goods as a means to help countries accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and is a proud champion and co-founder of the DPGA together with the government of Sierra Leone, UNICEF and iSPIRT.</p>



<p>Their work funds high-impact digital public goods in several sectors including health, early grade reading, climate and weather services, and plant pest management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Norway has worked on expanding existing digital public goods in both the health and education sectors. One example is <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/about">DHIS2</a>, an open source, web-based software platform for data collection, management, and analysis, used by governments and NGOs in more than 100 countries. Starting with a pilot in Sri Lanka, more than 30 countries have deployed standardized <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/covid-19">DHIS2 COVID-19 surveillance digital data packages</a> since the pandemic began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Norway has also seen a rapid scale up in the use of the <a href="https://digitallibrary.io/">Global Digital Library platform</a> for openly licensed early grade reading resources, and together with ADEA and UNESCO are also supporting a number of countries in translating early grade reading books into local languages, and fast-tracking the availability of <a href="https://freelearning.io/">learning resources</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>NEW: Follow the Digital Public Goods Alliance on Twitter</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/DPGAlliance"> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/DPGAlliance">@DPGAlliance</a></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/4ae88231c358/digital-public-goods-mailing-list">In our newsletter</a> last week, we kicked off <strong> a four part series to introduce the work of the Digital Public Goods Alliance Co-Founders. </strong>In each part, we will share exciting work from one of the Co-Founders and in this, our first week we’re featuring iSPIRT.</p>



<p>During the digital public goods roundtable event in mid-September Fabrizio Hochschild Drummond, Special Adviser on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the United Nations’ 75th Anniversary, shared that, “The digital world is a decentralized world and that is one of its virtues.” However, there must be some sense of coordination and access to this decentralized system and a unifying platform for digital public goods is a high priority.</p>



<p>One of the fundamental strengths of the Digital Public Goods (DPG) Alliance is its decentralized, yet coordinated structure. Each member of the current Interim Strategy Group (ISG) &#8211; consisting of iSPIRT, Norway, Sierra Leone and UNICEF &#8211; brings their own areas of expertise and interest to the DPG Alliance which makes it stronger and more diverse in its reach and potential impact. </p>



<p>As the DPG Alliance is built out over time, membership will expand and change to include more stakeholders.&nbsp;In this four part series, we’re pleased to offer a snapshot of the exciting work being led by each of the current ISG members. <strong>This week we focus on iSPIRT.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4>iSPIRT</h4>



<p><a href="https://ispirt.in">iSPIRT</a> (Indian Software Products Industry Round Table) is a non-profit think tank that builds public goods for Indian product startups to thrive and grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India is fast tracking digital development. In the last 10 years alone, over 400 million bank accounts were opened in India while at the same time it built up and delivered one of the most advanced payment systems in the world. All of this is thanks to accessible digital public goods.</p>



<p>Now, the Indian government is working on data empowerment and protection architecture to enable citizens to share their data to get a loan, apply for a visa etc. all in a seamless way via an open credit system. You can <a href="https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2020-09/DEPA-Book_0.pdf">read more about it in this paper</a>, prepared by iSPIRT. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06120857/Screenshot_2020-10-02-DEPA-Book_0-pdf.png" alt="" class="wp-image-565"/><figcaption>Reference: https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2020-09/DEPA-Book_0.pdf </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Extensive work has also begun in the healthcare sector with the creation of a public health registry that gives people the right to move their health data from one provider to another. As this process becomes standardized, turnaround times in the health care sector will be greatly reduced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a part of the Digital Public Goods Alliance, iSPIRT is leading by example in the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">Financial Inclusion Community of Practice</a> and can share learnings and best practices from their work with other governments. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On September 18, on the margins of the 2020 UN General Assembly, <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/">New America</a> &#8211; a Washington, D.C.-based think tank &#8211; hosted an online event to launch a #DigitalDecade. The #DigitalDecade is a commitment to build open source technology solutions that will improve the function of government in countries worldwide.<br></p>



<p>The Digital Public Goods Alliance was thrilled to see energy and thoughtful discussion around the vital role digital public goods play in strengthening institutions as well as the importance of joint commitments and innovative partnerships in this field. These changes must leverage open source software, open standards, shared funding models, and new multilateral architecture to help governments deploy next-generation technologies to power their institutions.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>All four DPG Alliance co-founders participated in the event, represented by Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, Minister David Sengeh of Sierra Leone, Sunita Grote from UNICEF, and Tanuj Bhojwani from iSPIRT. Several other stakeholders who are working closely with the Alliance also participated. Collectively, they represent years of expertise in funding open source technologies for the public sector including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Omidyar Network.<br></p>



<p>A recording of the event is available <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Recap%20Recording%20%20Resources%20Launching%20a%20DigitalDecade%20to%20Strengthen%20Public%20Institutions&amp;utm_content=Recap%20Recording%20%20Resources%20Launching%20a%20DigitalDecade%20to%20Strengthen%20Public%20Institutions+CID_e9d20ec2c1cb33555af41bcbdda0c23e&amp;utm_source=Campaign%20Monitor%20Newsletters&amp;utm_term=here">here</a>.<br></p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Event Highlights</strong><br></p>



<p>The event was very well-organized with highly relevant speakers and fresh insights on many topics related to the importance and promotion of digital public goods. We would like to highlight some of the remarks that we found particularly relevant for the Alliance’s work:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>New America called for <strong>using digital public goods to help build the next generation of digital government platforms</strong> and for <strong>more public sector technologies being released as open source</strong>.<strong> </strong>Representatives of platforms MOSIP and Mojaloop echoed this commitment to open source.</li><li>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation observed that donors have a critical role to play in ensuring the deployment of DPGs protects human rights, and that <strong>now is the time to marshall our collective resources. </strong>The Rockefeller Foundation supported this, emphasizing how <strong>philanthropic capital can be particularly relevant for bridging gaps </strong>between public and private funding.</li><li>Taiwanese Minister Audrey Tang recommended building the public’s trust by being<strong> fast, fair and fun</strong> and letting humour win over rumour.</li><li>Stakeholders like the Omidyar Network who have already taken action as thought leaders and early investors in open source digital public infrastructure, highlighted <strong>the need for arriving at a shared understanding</strong> of what digital public infrastructure means.</li><li>The Linux Foundation pointed out that <strong>the majority of code that the private sector and governments build on <em>is</em> open source</strong>, and that what is needed is for governments to understand what the right type of open source software is.&nbsp;</li><li>Rohini Nilekani emphasized <strong>societal platform thinking, </strong>and the need to design technologies for the inclusion of all.</li><li>Ried Hoffmann of LinkedIn made recommendations for how to collaborate better with the private sector, and in particular <strong>how</strong> <strong>governments can take the lead by pushing for more open source in public procurement</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, the importance of<strong> countries being in the driver’s seat</strong> to ensure technologies are locally relevant was highlighted by DPG Alliance co-founders Sierra Leone, iSPIRT and UNICEF. This was also reflected in the Open Government Partnership’s reference to <strong>co-creation</strong> as a method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Key Take-Aways&nbsp;</strong><br></p>



<p>A key take-away is the timeliness and relevance of the DPG Alliance’s work over the last year to establish <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/"><strong>a minimum open standard for digital public goods</strong></a>. Through the formulation of a set of precise criteria&nbsp; &#8211; widely consulted on and already endorsed by expert stakeholders across sectors including research, advocacy and technology &#8211; this minimum standard will ensure a focus on key safeguards, better coordination and less fragmentation as more stakeholders are looking to source, invest in, and implement digital public goods. We encourage you to assess and endorse the standard, or provide any suggestions for improvements through <a href="https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard">this GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>



<p>Second, is the value add that the DPG Alliance’s convening of communities of practice (CoPs) can bring. <strong>The CoP for financial inclusion stands out as particularly relevant following Friday’s discussion, as it seeks to identify digital public goods with the potential for implementation as part of a country’s digital public infrastructure (DPI). </strong>Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg highlighted the importance of systems for digital identity, civil registration and digital payments <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/144183dc9f125c64ba38531766cfda063f0">in her speech</a> on Norway’s strong support for digital public goods as a co-founder of the DPG Alliance.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Next Steps: Digital Public Infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br></p>



<p>DPI are technologies that tend to be “horizontals” &#8211; they are the rails that other solutions run on top of &#8211; and their implementation enables many other solutions and business models to flourish. In its Financial Inclusion CoP, the Digital Public Goods Alliance is seeking to identify the relatively few technologies that both comply with DPG Standard 1.0 <em>and</em> have the characteristics of Digital Public Infrastructure. The resulting shortlisted technologies will thereafter be assessed in more depth on indicators related to their relevance and adoptability for governments in low- and middle-income countries.<br></p>



<p>We firmly agree with Anne-Marie Slaughter of New America’s final statement to round off the event; “The efficacy has little to do with what was said here today and more to do with how we act in the months and years to come”.<br></p>



<p>From the Digital Public Goods Alliance’s end we promise to do our part to facilitate the discovery, development, use of and investment in digital public goods by uniting stakeholders around <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">comprehensive standards</a>, engaging experts through <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">communities of practices</a>, and increasing government, developer and public access through <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/platform/">a platform</a> of vetted digital public goods.&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In June 2020 the Secretary General of the United Nations published the “<a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>” which defined digital public goods as <em>“Open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable international and domestic laws, standards and best practices, and do no harm.”</em><br></p>



<p>This definition has been translated into <a href="/standard/">a 9-indicator standard</a> which we hope will serve as a comprehensive, shared definition to promote the discovery, development, use of and investment in digital public goods for a more equitable world. <br></p>



<p>This standard was developed from the original 51 indicator standard used by the Alliance in the preliminary review of <a href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/announcing-the-first-vetted-digital-public-goods-for-foundational-literacy-and-early-grade-reading-1f5c371a50d3">Early Grade Reading</a> projects and refined through the contributions of many experts and diverse stakeholders.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>If you know of projects that you believe meet the following standards and should be considered a digital public good, please </strong><a href="https://forms.gle/8w4pXRUqUV2oKAHi9"><strong>submit them</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>Digital Public Goods Standard 1.0&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Below is the full list of 9 indicators and requirements. These must be met in order for a nominated “project” (software, data, AI model, standard and/or piece of content) to be considered a digital public good.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>Thank you to: Sean P. Goggins,&nbsp; Professor, College of Engineering at University of Missouri; Matt Germonrez, Professor, College of Information Science &amp; Technology at University of Nebraska at Omaha; Georg J.P. Link, Open Source Strategist; Jon Lloyd, Director of Campaigns at Mozilla Foundation; Jamie Alexandre, Executive Director at Learning Equality; and Don Marti, for their endorsement of the DPG Standard as well as to the participants of the Early Grade Reading Community of Practice, UNICEF, Norway, iSPIRT, Sierra Leone and the DPG Alliance Secretariat for their contributions to this work.&nbsp;</em><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><thead><tr><th><strong>Indicator:</strong></th><th><strong>Requirement:</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1. Relevance to Sustainable Development Goals</strong></td><td>All projects must indicate the SDG(s) that they are relevant to and provide supporting links/documentation to support this relevance.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2. Use of approved open source license</strong></td><td>Projects must demonstrate the use of an approved open source license. For Open Source Software, we only accept OSI approved licenses.&nbsp;For Open Content we require the use of a Creative Commons license. While we encourage projects to use a license which allows for both derivatives and commercial reuse or dedicate content to the public domain (CC0) we also accept the following licenses which do not allow for commercial reuse: CC-BY-NC and CC-BY-NC-SA.&nbsp;For data we require a Open Data Commons approved license listed at opendefinition.org/licenses.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3. Documentation of ownership</strong></td><td>Ownership of everything that the project produces must be clearly defined and documented i.e. through copyright, trademark or other publicly available information.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4. Mandatory dependencies</strong></td><td>If the open source project has mandatory dependencies that create more restrictions than the original license the projects must be able to demonstrate independence from the closed component and/or indicate the existence of functional, open alternatives.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5. Documentation</strong></td><td>The project must have some documentation of the source code, use cases, and/or functional requirements.&nbsp;For content, this should indicate any relevant compatible apps, software, hardware required to access the content and instructions about how to use it.&nbsp;For software projects, this should be present as technical documentation that would allow a technical person unfamiliar with the project to&nbsp; launch and run the software.&nbsp;For data projects, this should be present as documentation that describes all the fields in the set, and provides context on how the data was collected and how it should be interpreted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6. Mechanism for Extracting Data</strong></td><td>If this project has non personally identifiable information there must be a mechanism for extracting or importing non personally identifiable information (PII) data from the system in a non-proprietary format.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><em>Note that evidence for requirements 7-9 can only be given by someone authorized to speak on behalf of the project. We collect title, name and contact information to confirm this authority.&nbsp; </em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>7. Adherence to privacy and applicable laws</strong></td><td>The project must state that it complies with relevant privacy laws, and all applicable international and domestic laws.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>8. Adherence to standards &amp; best practices</strong></td><td>Projects must demonstrate some adherence to standards, best practices and/or principles. i.e. the principles for digital development</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9. Do No Harm&nbsp;</strong></td><td>All projects must demonstrate that they have taken steps to ensure that the project anticipates, prevents and does no harm.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9a) Privacy &amp; Freedom of Expression</strong></td><td>All projects must have strategies in place to anticipate, respond to and minimize adverse impacts on privacy and freedom of expression where governments are believed to be using the project’s product or services for illegitimate or political purposes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9b) Data Privacy &amp; Security</strong></td><td>Project’s that collect data must identify the types of data collected and stored and demonstrate that the project ensures the privacy and security of this data and has taken steps to prevent adverse impacts resulting from it&#8217;s collection, storage and distribution.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9c) Inappropriate &amp; Illegal Content</strong></td><td>Projects that collect, store or distribute content must have policies identifying inappropriate and illegal content such as child sexual abuse materials and mechanisms for detecting and moderating inappropriate/illegal content.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9d) Protection from harassment</strong></td><td>If the project facilitates interactions with or between users or contributors there must be a mechanism for users and contributors to protect themselves against grief, abuse, and harassment. The project must have a mechanism to address the safety and security of underage users.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<ul><li>The presentation also highlighted two potential Digital Public Goods in which the Alliance co-champions are involved. These examples help to illustrate the potential of Digital Public Goods when deployed at scale, a model the Alliance hopes to emulate:<ul><li><a href="https://www.dhis2.org/"> DHIS2</a>: Ongoing pilots in the Gambia and Uganda to use DHIS2 for digitalization of Education Management Information Systems (EMIS)</li><li><a href="https://www.mosip.io/">MOSIP</a>: Morocco and the Philippines<strong> </strong>adopting MOSIP for a national roll out of their national identity system.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>To conclude the presentation, we included several<strong> </strong>engagement opportunities for the high-level panel participants with the goal of expanding our collaborations with them in the future.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce the first set of vetted digital public goods, a list of openly licensed platforms, content, and technologies focused on Early Grade Reading that have been reviewed by a group of experts and assessed as meeting a basic set of criteria to be considered a digital public good.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/30183101/Screen-Shot-2020-10-29-at-3.57.39-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-641"/></figure>



<p>The aim of the&nbsp;<a href="http://digitalpublicgoods.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>&nbsp;is to facilitate the discovery, development, use of, and investment in, openly licensed technologies, data models, and content of high relevance for attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In order to accomplish this in 2019 we began convening networks of partners from different sectors into Communities of Practice (CoP) to contribute to the identification, support, scale-up, and proper use of digital public goods (DPGs).</p>



<p>Late last year we launched our first CoP pilot by gathering an initial group of experts around Early Grade Reading to identify and review potential digital public goods.</p>



<h1 id="2d57">Why Early Grade Reading?</h1>



<p>Knowing how to read is essential for individuals to thrive and learn throughout life, and for participating in modern society. It is a key sub-goal within SDG4, and is an enabler of many of the other sustainable development goals. Still, More than 617 million children and adolescents are not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading, and the number of illiterate adults stands at around 773 million, according to estimates from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic also spurred our initial attention on Early Grade Reading as we saw schools close and nearly all countries overnight having to shift to remote learning. This shift dramatically increased the need for learning materials that could be used at the household level, including more reading resources in the languages used by children and parents in their home settings.</p>



<p>The goal was to quickly identify and vet a list of potential digital public goods for foundational literacy and early grade reading.</p>



<h1 id="8c6a">Creating Assessment Criteria</h1>



<p>At the outset of this process the DPG Alliance had a definition of digital public goods as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm and are of high relevance for attainment of the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>However it was necessary to turn that broad definition into a specific set of indicators that could apply across domains, while also encompassing domain-specific considerations and criteria.</p>



<p>In order to achieve this we convened two different groups: one technical group to define a set of indicators that would apply across domains, and a domain-specific group on literacy. The technical group focused on assumed generic issues related to interoperability, re-usability, accessibility and child online safety, while the literacy group looked at topics such as pedagogical quality and content appropriateness.</p>



<p>In consultation with our group of experts and drawing inspiration from DIAL, Digital Health and others we developed an initial set of&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7Sv0W1sENADG1uEFEzclgcGlbRdXb-NHgMt0zeilJ_xDGDsaY1SclSiZkAcLE1sm-nUxCOc2EVpmY/pubhtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these 11 categories and 51 indicators</a>&nbsp;with which to assess the first set of potential Digital Public Goods.</p>



<p>The categories were:</p>



<ol><li>Licenses and Copyright</li><li>Utility and Impact</li><li>Benchmarks</li><li>Product Design</li><li>Product Quality</li><li>Community</li><li>Do No Harm</li><li>Best Practices</li><li>Content</li><li>Quality</li><li>Financial Sustainability</li></ol>



<h1 id="85bc">List of approved digital public goods for foundational literacy and early grade reading</h1>



<p>The projects below have been vetted against the criteria described above, in the first exercise of this kind for the Digital Public Goods Alliance. The assessment has been done by a group composed of experts from UNESCO, USAID, Creative Commons, ADEA, Mozilla, Education Development Center, Foundation for Learning Equality, the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, and Humans at Play. Some of the criteria, such as “license compliance with digital public goods requirements” are binary, whereas scores on others have been assessed in relation to one another, or information has been collected more for informational purposes.</p>



<p>The projects below were all approved by the expert group as meeting minimum criteria for digital public goods and we are continuing to adjust, expand and revise our structures for vetting as the Alliance continues to form. The Digital Public Goods Alliance is following up with several of the projects on improvement potential such as suggestions for improving accessibility, or for making licensing information more readily discoverable.</p>



<p><em>The detailed assessment of all 8 successful projects is openly available&nbsp;</em><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQOt9P4-E2q3NOl5HvlhTpD7tgufFfAK2k1UEWOfSjyv7H5QMu7MYIWxyin4Zn2ymn4Fdm2Ucbwwns9/pubhtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
