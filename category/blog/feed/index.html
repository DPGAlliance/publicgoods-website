<p>On September 18, on the margins of the 2020 UN General Assembly, <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/">New America</a> &#8211; a Washington, D.C.-based think tank &#8211; hosted an online event to launch a #DigitalDecade. The #DigitalDecade is a commitment to build open source technology solutions that will improve the function of government in countries worldwide.<br></p>



<p>The Digital Public Goods Alliance was thrilled to see energy and thoughtful discussion around the vital role digital public goods play in strengthening institutions as well as the importance of joint commitments and innovative partnerships in this field. These changes must leverage open source software, open standards, shared funding models, and new multilateral architecture to help governments deploy next-generation technologies to power their institutions.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>All four DPG Alliance co-founders participated in the event, represented by Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, Minister David Sengeh of Sierra Leone, Sunita Grote from UNICEF, and Tanuj Bhojwani from iSPIRT. Several other stakeholders who are working closely with the Alliance also participated. Collectively, they represent years of expertise in funding open source technologies for the public sector including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Omidyar Network.<br></p>



<p>A recording of the event is available <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Recap%20Recording%20%20Resources%20Launching%20a%20DigitalDecade%20to%20Strengthen%20Public%20Institutions&amp;utm_content=Recap%20Recording%20%20Resources%20Launching%20a%20DigitalDecade%20to%20Strengthen%20Public%20Institutions+CID_e9d20ec2c1cb33555af41bcbdda0c23e&amp;utm_source=Campaign%20Monitor%20Newsletters&amp;utm_term=here">here</a>.<br></p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Event Highlights</strong><br></p>



<p>The event was very well-organized with highly relevant speakers and fresh insights on many topics related to the importance and promotion of digital public goods. We would like to highlight some of the remarks that we found particularly relevant for the Alliance’s work:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>New America called for <strong>using digital public goods to help build the next generation of digital government platforms</strong> and for <strong>more public sector technologies being released as open source</strong>.<strong> </strong>Representatives of platforms MOSIP and Mojaloop echoed this commitment to open source.</li><li>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation observed that donors have a critical role to play in ensuring the deployment of DPGs protects human rights, and that <strong>now is the time to marshall our collective resources. </strong>The Rockefeller Foundation supported this, emphasizing how <strong>philanthropic capital can be particularly relevant for bridging gaps </strong>between public and private funding.</li><li>Taiwanese Minister Audrey Tang recommended building the public’s trust by being<strong> fast, fair and fun</strong> and letting humour win over rumour.</li><li>Stakeholders like the Omidyar Network who have already taken action as thought leaders and early investors in open source digital public infrastructure, highlighted <strong>the need for arriving at a shared understanding</strong> of what digital public infrastructure means.</li><li>The Linux Foundation pointed out that <strong>the majority of code that the private sector and governments build on <em>is</em> open source</strong>, and that what is needed is for governments to understand what the right type of open source software is.&nbsp;</li><li>Rohini Nilekani emphasized <strong>societal platform thinking, </strong>and the need to design technologies for the inclusion of all.</li><li>Ried Hoffmann of LinkedIn made recommendations for how to collaborate better with the private sector, and in particular <strong>how</strong> <strong>governments can take the lead by pushing for more open source in public procurement</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, the importance of<strong> countries being in the driver’s seat</strong> to ensure technologies are locally relevant was highlighted by DPG Alliance co-founders Sierra Leone, iSPIRT and UNICEF. This was also reflected in the Open Government Partnership’s reference to <strong>co-creation</strong> as a method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Key Take-Aways&nbsp;</strong><br></p>



<p>A key take-away is the timeliness and relevance of the DPG Alliance’s work over the last year to establish <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/"><strong>a minimum open standard for digital public goods</strong></a>. Through the formulation of a set of precise criteria&nbsp; &#8211; widely consulted on and already endorsed by expert stakeholders across sectors including research, advocacy and technology &#8211; this minimum standard will ensure a focus on key safeguards, better coordination and less fragmentation as more stakeholders are looking to source, invest in, and implement digital public goods. We encourage you to assess and endorse the standard, or provide any suggestions for improvements through <a href="https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard">this GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>



<p>Second, is the value add that the DPG Alliance’s convening of communities of practice (CoPs) can bring. <strong>The CoP for financial inclusion stands out as particularly relevant following Friday’s discussion, as it seeks to identify digital public goods with the potential for implementation as part of a country’s digital public infrastructure (DPI). </strong>Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg highlighted the importance of systems for digital identity, civil registration and digital payments <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/144183dc9f125c64ba38531766cfda063f0">in her speech</a> on Norway’s strong support for digital public goods as a co-founder of the DPG Alliance.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Next Steps: Digital Public Infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br></p>



<p>DPI are technologies that tend to be “horizontals” &#8211; they are the rails that other solutions run on top of &#8211; and their implementation enables many other solutions and business models to flourish. In its Financial Inclusion CoP, the Digital Public Goods Alliance is seeking to identify the relatively few technologies that both comply with DPG Standard 1.0 <em>and</em> have the characteristics of Digital Public Infrastructure. The resulting shortlisted technologies will thereafter be assessed in more depth on indicators related to their relevance and adoptability for governments in low- and middle-income countries.<br></p>



<p>We firmly agree with Anne-Marie Slaughter of New America’s final statement to round off the event; “The efficacy has little to do with what was said here today and more to do with how we act in the months and years to come”.<br></p>



<p>From the Digital Public Goods Alliance’s end we promise to do our part to facilitate the discovery, development, use of and investment in digital public goods by uniting stakeholders around <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">comprehensive standards</a>, engaging experts through <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">communities of practices</a>, and increasing government, developer and public access through <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/platform/">a platform</a> of vetted digital public goods.&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In June 2020 the Secretary General of the United Nations published the “<a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>” which defined digital public goods as <em>“Open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable international and domestic laws, standards and best practices, and do no harm.”</em><br></p>



<p>This definition has been translated into <a href="/standard/">a 9-indicator standard</a> which we hope will serve as a comprehensive, shared definition to promote the discovery, development, use of and investment in digital public goods for a more equitable world. <br></p>



<p>This standard was developed from the original 51 indicator standard used by the Alliance in the preliminary review of <a href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/announcing-the-first-vetted-digital-public-goods-for-foundational-literacy-and-early-grade-reading-1f5c371a50d3">Early Grade Reading</a> projects and refined through the contributions of many experts and diverse stakeholders.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>If you know of projects that you believe meet the following standards and should be considered a digital public good, please </strong><a href="https://forms.gle/8w4pXRUqUV2oKAHi9"><strong>submit them</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>Digital Public Goods Standard 1.0&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Below is the full list of 9 indicators and requirements. These must be met in order for a nominated “project” (software, data, AI model, standard and/or piece of content) to be considered a digital public good.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>Thank you to: Sean P. Goggins,&nbsp; Professor, College of Engineering at University of Missouri; Matt Germonrez, Professor, College of Information Science &amp; Technology at University of Nebraska at Omaha; Georg J.P. Link, Open Source Strategist; Jon Lloyd, Director of Campaigns at Mozilla Foundation; Jamie Alexandre, Executive Director at Learning Equality; and Don Marti, for their endorsement of the DPG Standard as well as to the participants of the Early Grade Reading Community of Practice, UNICEF, Norway, iSPIRT, Sierra Leone and the DPG Alliance Secretariat for their contributions to this work.&nbsp;</em><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><thead><tr><th><strong>Indicator:</strong></th><th><strong>Requirement:</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1. Relevance to Sustainable Development Goals</strong></td><td>All projects must indicate the SDG(s) that they are relevant to and provide supporting links/documentation to support this relevance.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2.

Documentation of ownership</strong></td><td>Ownership of everything that the project produces must be clearly defined and documented i.e. through copyright, trademark or other publicly available information.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4. Mandatory dependencies</strong></td><td>If the open source project has mandatory dependencies that create more restrictions than the original license the projects must be able to demonstrate independence from the closed component and/or indicate the existence of functional, open alternatives.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5. Documentation</strong></td><td>The project must have some documentation of the source code, use cases, and/or functional requirements.&nbsp;For content, this should indicate any relevant compatible apps, software, hardware required to access the content and instructions about how to use it.&nbsp;For software projects, this should be present as technical documentation that would allow a technical person unfamiliar with the project to&nbsp; launch and run the software.&nbsp;For data projects, this should be present as documentation that describes all the fields in the set, and provides context on how the data was collected and how it should be interpreted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6. Mechanism for Extracting Data</strong></td><td>If this project has non personally identifiable information there must be a mechanism for extracting or importing non personally identifiable information (PII) data from the system in a non-proprietary format.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p> </p>



<ul class="bulletitemspaced"><li>The Digital Public Goods Alliance has established an interim Secretariat co-led by UNICEF and Norway to coordinate and operationalize the work of the Alliance. The 4 initial Co-Champions; Sierra Leone, iSPIRT, UNICEF and Norway form an Interim Strategy Group, which will evolve into a formalized governance structure by Q4 2021.<br></li><li>The<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net"> Digital Public Goods Platform</a> is streamlining the submission of nominations through an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGzlBiecPBlVvJXmcMKXF3zdxASY8vGnrdnNNwp7fVKb169A/viewform">online form</a>, while aligning with other partners developing similar lists (<a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/">Digital Impact Alliance</a> and<a href="https://ovio.org/"> Ovio</a>). The Alliance is in the final stages of creating a <strong>Digital Public Goods Standard 1.0</strong>, working with partners to create a comprehensive, shared assessment criteria.<br></li><li>The <strong>Communities of Practice (CoPs) </strong>are groups of experts who convene to support the discovery, assessment and advancement of high-potential Digital Public Goods within a priority area. In 2020 there are four communities of practice:<ul><li><strong>Early grade reading</strong>: Concluded July 2020 with 8 vetted DPGs</li><li><strong>Financial inclusion</strong>: Focus on foundational technologies for financial inclusion. Currently identifying projects for additional assessment.</li><li><strong>Climate Change Adaptation</strong>: Focus on climate and weather services. There are 30 identified projects for review by the full CoP. </li><li><strong>Digital Health</strong>: Currently forming an Advisory Group.<br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Pathfinder countries</strong> are those who take a leadership and pioneering role in the development, adoption and implementation of Digital Public Goods. <strong>Jordan </strong>was the first country to formally join the Alliance as a Pathfinder Country in the spring of 2020 and is deploying a Digital Public Good for youth employment.<br><br>The Alliance is also exploring engagement with the following countries as potential pathfinders:<ul><li><strong>Ghana</strong> (exploratory) is convening local stakeholders to select and implement 2 to 3 Digital Public Goods at a subnational scale within the first year.</li><li><strong>Niger</strong> (exploratory) is focusing on digital skills and education content.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li>The presentation also highlighted two potential Digital Public Goods in which the Alliance co-champions are involved. These examples help to illustrate the potential of Digital Public Goods when deployed at scale, a model the Alliance hopes to emulate:<ul><li><a href="https://www.dhis2.org/"> DHIS2</a>: Ongoing pilots in the Gambia and Uganda to use DHIS2 for digitalization of Education Management Information Systems (EMIS)</li><li><a href="https://www.mosip.io/">MOSIP</a>: Morocco and the Philippines<strong> </strong>adopting MOSIP for a national roll out of their national identity system.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>To conclude the presentation, we included several<strong> </strong>engagement opportunities for the high-level panel participants with the goal of expanding our collaborations with them in the future.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce the first set of vetted digital public goods, a list of openly licensed platforms, content, and technologies focused on Early Grade Reading that have been reviewed by a group of experts and assessed as meeting a basic set of criteria to be considered a digital public good.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1324/1*aSlzYlHQiRXTlqVhEP-xYw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The aim of the&nbsp;<a href="http://digitalpublicgoods.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>&nbsp;is to facilitate the discovery, development, use of, and investment in, openly licensed technologies, data models, and content of high relevance for attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In order to accomplish this in 2019 we began convening networks of partners from different sectors into Communities of Practice (CoP) to contribute to the identification, support, scale-up, and proper use of digital public goods (DPGs).</p>



<p>Late last year we launched our first CoP pilot by gathering an initial group of experts around Early Grade Reading to identify and review potential digital public goods.</p>



<h1 id="2d57">Why Early Grade Reading?</h1>



<p>Knowing how to read is essential for individuals to thrive and learn throughout life, and for participating in modern society. It is a key sub-goal within SDG4, and is an enabler of many of the other sustainable development goals. Still, More than 617 million children and adolescents are not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading, and the number of illiterate adults stands at around 773 million, according to estimates from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic also spurred our initial attention on Early Grade Reading as we saw schools close and nearly all countries overnight having to shift to remote learning. This shift dramatically increased the need for learning materials that could be used at the household level, including more reading resources in the languages used by children and parents in their home settings.</p>



<p>The goal was to quickly identify and vet a list of potential digital public goods for foundational literacy and early grade reading.</p>



<h1 id="8c6a">Creating Assessment Criteria</h1>



<p>At the outset of this process the DPG Alliance had a definition of digital public goods as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm and are of high relevance for attainment of the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>However it was necessary to turn that broad definition into a specific set of indicators that could apply across domains, while also encompassing domain-specific considerations and criteria.</p>



<p>In order to achieve this we convened two different groups: one technical group to define a set of indicators that would apply across domains, and a domain-specific group on literacy. The technical group focused on assumed generic issues related to interoperability, re-usability, accessibility and child online safety, while the literacy group looked at topics such as pedagogical quality and content appropriateness.</p>



<p>In consultation with our group of experts and drawing inspiration from DIAL, Digital Health and others we developed an initial set of&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7Sv0W1sENADG1uEFEzclgcGlbRdXb-NHgMt0zeilJ_xDGDsaY1SclSiZkAcLE1sm-nUxCOc2EVpmY/pubhtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these 11 categories and 51 indicators</a>&nbsp;with which to assess the first set of potential Digital Public Goods.</p>



<p>The categories were:</p>



<ol><li>Licenses and Copyright</li><li>Utility and Impact</li><li>Benchmarks</li><li>Product Design</li><li>Product Quality</li><li>Community</li><li>Do No Harm</li><li>Best Practices</li><li>Content</li><li>Quality</li><li>Financial Sustainability</li></ol>



<h1 id="85bc">List of approved digital public goods for foundational literacy and early grade reading</h1>



<p>The projects below have been vetted against the criteria described above, in the first exercise of this kind for the Digital Public Goods Alliance. The assessment has been done by a group composed of experts from UNESCO, USAID, Creative Commons, ADEA, Mozilla, Education Development Center, Foundation for Learning Equality, the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, and Humans at Play. Some of the criteria, such as “license compliance with digital public goods requirements” are binary, whereas scores on others have been assessed in relation to one another, or information has been collected more for informational purposes.</p>



<p>The projects below were all approved by the expert group as meeting minimum criteria for digital public goods and we are continuing to adjust, expand and revise our structures for vetting as the Alliance continues to form. The Digital Public Goods Alliance is following up with several of the projects on improvement potential such as suggestions for improving accessibility, or for making licensing information more readily discoverable.</p>
