<p><strong>This is the third in a four-part series featuring exciting work from the Co-Founders of the Digital Public Goods Alliance. </strong>This week we’re featuring Sierra Leone.</p>



<p> If you missed it, check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-1-meet-our-co-founders-ispirt-61f1f41d6642" target="_blank">Part 1 on iSPIRT</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-2-meet-our-co-founder-norway-1020112d1ad6" target="_blank">Part 2 on Norway</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sierra Leone&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>&nbsp;Sierra Leone’s Directorate of Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (DSTI) has highlighted how youth empowerment, economic reform and health infrastructure can open up regional possibilities. Like iSPIRT, Sierra Leone is leading by example, creating a virtuous cycle driven by their four pillars (Data for Decision Making, Service Delivery &amp; Citizen Engagement, Data Systems &amp; Technology Design, and Ecosystem Strengthening) that serve as a foundation to turn Sierra Leone into an innovation and entrepreneurship hub, that other developing countries can emulate.&nbsp;<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>The DSTI in particular is playing a key role by engaging private sector and university communities to help build the technology that makes the implementation of digital public goods possible. This comes from an understanding that, in order for DPGs to evolve at scale and with a lower barrier to entry, there needs to be a supportive ecosystem built up that addresses questions of resourcing and intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sierra Leone is also <a href="https://www.dsti.gov.sl/sierra-leone-national-innovation-digital-strategy-2019-2029">setting an example</a> by documenting their progress and lessons learned. DSTI gathers data to support policy and decision-making in the public interest and makes relevant data gathered throughout the process publicly available.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NEW: Follow the Digital Public Goods Alliance on Twitter</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/DPGAlliance"> @DPGAlliance</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Last week we kicked off a four part series. </strong>In each part, we will share exciting work from one of the Co-Founders of the Digital Public Goods Alliance. This week we’re featuring Norway.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-1-meet-our-co-founders-ispirt-61f1f41d6642" target="_blank">If you missed Part 1 on iSPIRT last week, you can see it here.</a></p>



<p>As we said last week, one of the fundamental strengths of the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) is its decentralized, yet coordinated structure. Each member of the current Interim Strategy Group (ISG) &#8211; consisting of iSPIRT, Norway, Sierra Leone and UNICEF &#8211; brings their own areas of expertise and interest to the DPGA which makes it stronger and more diverse in its reach and potential impact. As the DPGA is built out over time, membership will expand and change to include more stakeholders.&nbsp;In this four part series, we’re pleased to offer a snapshot of the exciting work being led by each of the current ISG members. <strong>This week we focus on Norway.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Norway</strong></h4>



<p>Norway believes in the deployment of digital public goods as a means to help countries accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and is a proud champion and co-founder of the DPGA together with the government of Sierra Leone, UNICEF and iSPIRT.</p>



<p>Their work funds high-impact digital public goods in several sectors including health, early grade reading, climate and weather services, and plant pest management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Norway has worked on expanding existing digital public goods in both the health and education sectors. One example is <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/about">DHIS2</a>, an open source, web-based software platform for data collection, management, and analysis, used by governments and NGOs in more than 100 countries. Starting with a pilot in Sri Lanka, more than 30 countries have deployed standardized <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/covid-19">DHIS2 COVID-19 surveillance digital data packages</a> since the pandemic began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Norway has also seen a rapid scale up in the use of the <a href="https://digitallibrary.io/">Global Digital Library platform</a> for openly licensed early grade reading resources, and together with ADEA and UNESCO are also supporting a number of countries in translating early grade reading books into local languages, and fast-tracking the availability of <a href="https://freelearning.io/">learning resources</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13115228/Screenshot_2020-10-08-Meld-St-11-2019%E2%80%932020-Report-to-the-Storting-white-paper-Summary.png" alt="" class="wp-image-580"/><figcaption>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meldst11_summary/id2699502/?ch=1</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the DPGA develops, Norway would like to engage other bilateral and philanthropic donors in conversations on how each can best contribute to supporting the global architecture around digital public goods.   </p>



<p>You can find out more about Norway’s commitment to digital public goods by reading their white paper for <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meldst11_summary/id2699502/?utm_source=www.regjeringen.no&amp;utm_medium=epost&amp;utm_campaign=nyhetsvarsel%2024.04.2020&amp;utm_content=Utviklingssamarbeid">Digital Transformation and Development Policy</a> or watching <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/144183dc9f125c64ba38531766cfda063f0">this address</a> from Prime Minister Solberg. </p>



<p>Norway is co-hosting the DPGA and will engage at the forefront of the Climate Adaptation Community of Practice. </p>

<p>Since its launch, the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a> &#8212; an initiative co-founded by iSPIRT, Sierra Leone, The Government of Norway and UNICEF &#8212; has been working to identify, support and promote digital public goods to implement recommendation 1B from the <a href="https://digitalcooperation.org/">June 2019 Report of the UN Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation</a>.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In June 2020 the Secretary General of the United Nations published the “<a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>” which defined digital public goods as <em>“Open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable international and domestic laws, standards and best practices, and do no harm.”</em><br></p>



<p>This definition has been translated into <a href="/standard/">a 9-indicator standard</a> which we hope will serve as a comprehensive, shared definition to promote the discovery, development, use of and investment in digital public goods for a more equitable world. <br></p>



<p>This standard was developed from the original 51 indicator standard used by the Alliance in the preliminary review of <a href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/announcing-the-first-vetted-digital-public-goods-for-foundational-literacy-and-early-grade-reading-1f5c371a50d3">Early Grade Reading</a> projects and refined through the contributions of many experts and diverse stakeholders.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>If you know of projects that you believe meet the following standards and should be considered a digital public good, please </strong><a href="https://forms.gle/8w4pXRUqUV2oKAHi9"><strong>submit them</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>Digital Public Goods Standard 1.0&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Below is the full list of 9 indicators and requirements. These must be met in order for a nominated “project” (software, data, AI model, standard and/or piece of content) to be considered a digital public good.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>Thank you to: Sean P. Goggins,&nbsp; Professor, College of Engineering at University of Missouri; Matt Germonrez, Professor, College of Information Science &amp; Technology at University of Nebraska at Omaha; Georg J.P. Link, Open Source Strategist; Jon Lloyd, Director of Campaigns at Mozilla Foundation; Jamie Alexandre, Executive Director at Learning Equality; and Don Marti, for their endorsement of the DPG Standard as well as to the participants of the Early Grade Reading Community of Practice, UNICEF, Norway, iSPIRT, Sierra Leone and the DPG Alliance Secretariat for their contributions to this work.&nbsp;</em><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><thead><tr><th><strong>Indicator:</strong></th><th><strong>Requirement:</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1. Relevance to Sustainable Development Goals</strong></td><td>All projects must indicate the SDG(s) that they are relevant to and provide supporting links/documentation to support this relevance.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2. Use of approved open source license</strong></td><td>Projects must demonstrate the use of an approved open source license. For Open Source Software, we only accept OSI approved licenses.&nbsp;For Open Content we require the use of a Creative Commons license. While we encourage projects to use a license which allows for both derivatives and commercial reuse or dedicate content to the public domain (CC0) we also accept the following licenses which do not allow for commercial reuse: CC-BY-NC and CC-BY-NC-SA.&nbsp;For data we require a Open Data Commons approved license listed at opendefinition.org/licenses.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3. Documentation of ownership</strong></td><td>Ownership of everything that the project produces must be clearly defined and documented i.e. through copyright, trademark or other publicly available information.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4. Mandatory dependencies</strong></td><td>If the open source project has mandatory dependencies that create more restrictions than the original license the projects must be able to demonstrate independence from the closed component and/or indicate the existence of functional, open alternatives.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5. Documentation</strong></td><td>The project must have some documentation of the source code, use cases, and/or functional requirements.&nbsp;For content, this should indicate any relevant compatible apps, software, hardware required to access the content and instructions about how to use it.&nbsp;For software projects, this should be present as technical documentation that would allow a technical person unfamiliar with the project to&nbsp; launch and run the software.&nbsp;For data projects, this should be present as documentation that describes all the fields in the set, and provides context on how the data was collected and how it should be interpreted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6. Mechanism for Extracting Data</strong></td><td>If this project has non personally identifiable information there must be a mechanism for extracting or importing non personally identifiable information (PII) data from the system in a non-proprietary format.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><em>Note that evidence for requirements 7-9 can only be given by someone authorized to speak on behalf of the project. We collect title, name and contact information to confirm this authority.&nbsp; </em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>7. Adherence to privacy and applicable laws</strong></td><td>The project must state that it complies with relevant privacy laws, and all applicable international and domestic laws.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>8. Adherence to standards &amp; best practices</strong></td><td>Projects must demonstrate some adherence to standards, best practices and/or principles. i.e. the principles for digital development</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9. Do No Harm&nbsp;</strong></td><td>All projects must demonstrate that they have taken steps to ensure that the project anticipates, prevents and does no harm.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9a) Privacy &amp; Freedom of Expression</strong></td><td>All projects must have strategies in place to anticipate, respond to and minimize adverse impacts on privacy and freedom of expression where governments are believed to be using the project’s product or services for illegitimate or political purposes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9b) Data Privacy &amp; Security</strong></td><td>Project’s that collect data must identify the types of data collected and stored and demonstrate that the project ensures the privacy and security of this data and has taken steps to prevent adverse impacts resulting from it&#8217;s collection, storage and distribution.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9c) Inappropriate &amp; Illegal Content</strong></td><td>Projects that collect, store or distribute content must have policies identifying inappropriate and illegal content such as child sexual abuse materials and mechanisms for detecting and moderating inappropriate/illegal content.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9d) Protection from harassment</strong></td><td>If the project facilitates interactions with or between users or contributors there must be a mechanism for users and contributors to protect themselves against grief, abuse, and harassment. The project must have a mechanism to address the safety and security of underage users.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This morning the Digital Public Goods Alliance participated in a roundtable organized by the United Nations Secretary General’s Office on the implementation of recommendation 1B from the <a href="https://digitalcooperation.org/">Report of the High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation</a>, and subsequent <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>.</p>



<p>We provided a detailed update on the activities of the Alliance over the past 6 months, and shared the roadmap for our future work. Some highlights from this presentation are included below, as well as the link to the complete presentation.</p>



<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSZq5MmiwnptRYTI1pgQKUKfiYMRKM4NSte8p2DEkzOxQmkYMtmYn2HN-V1MiUUtg/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>



<p> </p>



<ul class="bulletitemspaced"><li>The Digital Public Goods Alliance has established an interim Secretariat co-led by UNICEF and Norway to coordinate and operationalize the work of the Alliance. The 4 initial Co-Champions; Sierra Leone, iSPIRT, UNICEF and Norway form an Interim Strategy Group, which will evolve into a formalized governance structure by Q4 2021.<br></li><li>The<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net"> Digital Public Goods Platform</a> is streamlining the submission of nominations through an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGzlBiecPBlVvJXmcMKXF3zdxASY8vGnrdnNNwp7fVKb169A/viewform">online form</a>, while aligning with other partners developing similar lists (<a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/">Digital Impact Alliance</a> and<a href="https://ovio.org/"> Ovio</a>). The Alliance is in the final stages of creating a <strong>Digital Public Goods Standard 1.0</strong>, working with partners to create a comprehensive, shared assessment criteria.<br></li><li>The <strong>Communities of Practice (CoPs) </strong>are groups of experts who convene to support the discovery, assessment and advancement of high-potential Digital Public Goods within a priority area. In 2020 there are four communities of practice:<ul><li><strong>Early grade reading</strong>: Concluded July 2020 with 8 vetted DPGs</li><li><strong>Financial inclusion</strong>: Focus on foundational technologies for financial inclusion. Currently identifying projects for additional assessment.</li><li><strong>Climate Change Adaptation</strong>: Focus on climate and weather services. There are 30 identified projects for review by the full CoP. </li><li><strong>Digital Health</strong>: Currently forming an Advisory Group.<br></li></ul></li><li><strong>Pathfinder countries</strong> are those who take a leadership and pioneering role in the development, adoption and implementation of Digital Public Goods. <strong>Jordan </strong>was the first country to formally join the Alliance as a Pathfinder Country in the spring of 2020 and is deploying a Digital Public Good for youth employment.<br><br>The Alliance is also exploring engagement with the following countries as potential pathfinders:<ul><li><strong>Ghana</strong> (exploratory) is convening local stakeholders to select and implement 2 to 3 Digital Public Goods at a subnational scale within the first year.</li><li><strong>Niger</strong> (exploratory) is focusing on digital skills and education content.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li>The presentation also highlighted two potential Digital Public Goods in which the Alliance co-champions are involved. These examples help to illustrate the potential of Digital Public Goods when deployed at scale, a model the Alliance hopes to emulate:<ul><li><a href="https://www.dhis2.org/"> DHIS2</a>: Ongoing pilots in the Gambia and Uganda to use DHIS2 for digitalization of Education Management Information Systems (EMIS)</li><li><a href="https://www.mosip.io/">MOSIP</a>: Morocco and the Philippines<strong> </strong>adopting MOSIP for a national roll out of their national identity system.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>To conclude the presentation, we included several<strong> </strong>engagement opportunities for the high-level panel participants with the goal of expanding our collaborations with them in the future.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce the first set of vetted digital public goods, a list of openly licensed platforms, content, and technologies focused on Early Grade Reading that have been reviewed by a group of experts and assessed as meeting a basic set of criteria to be considered a digital public good.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1324/1*aSlzYlHQiRXTlqVhEP-xYw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The aim of the&nbsp;<a href="http://digitalpublicgoods.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>&nbsp;is to facilitate the discovery, development, use of, and investment in, openly licensed technologies, data models, and content of high relevance for attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In order to accomplish this in 2019 we began convening networks of partners from different sectors into Communities of Practice (CoP) to contribute to the identification, support, scale-up, and proper use of digital public goods (DPGs).</p>



<p>Late last year we launched our first CoP pilot by gathering an initial group of experts around Early Grade Reading to identify and review potential digital public goods.</p>



<h1 id="2d57">Why Early Grade Reading?</h1>



<p>Knowing how to read is essential for individuals to thrive and learn throughout life, and for participating in modern society. It is a key sub-goal within SDG4, and is an enabler of many of the other sustainable development goals. Still, More than 617 million children and adolescents are not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading, and the number of illiterate adults stands at around 773 million, according to estimates from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic also spurred our initial attention on Early Grade Reading as we saw schools close and nearly all countries overnight having to shift to remote learning. This shift dramatically increased the need for learning materials that could be used at the household level, including more reading resources in the languages used by children and parents in their home settings.</p>



<p>The goal was to quickly identify and vet a list of potential digital public goods for foundational literacy and early grade reading.</p>



<h1 id="8c6a">Creating Assessment Criteria</h1>



<p>At the outset of this process the DPG Alliance had a definition of digital public goods as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm and are of high relevance for attainment of the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>However it was necessary to turn that broad definition into a specific set of indicators that could apply across domains, while also encompassing domain-specific considerations and criteria.</p>



<p>In order to achieve this we convened two different groups: one technical group to define a set of indicators that would apply across domains, and a domain-specific group on literacy. The technical group focused on assumed generic issues related to interoperability, re-usability, accessibility and child online safety, while the literacy group looked at topics such as pedagogical quality and content appropriateness.</p>



<p>In consultation with our group of experts and drawing inspiration from DIAL, Digital Health and others we developed an initial set of&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7Sv0W1sENADG1uEFEzclgcGlbRdXb-NHgMt0zeilJ_xDGDsaY1SclSiZkAcLE1sm-nUxCOc2EVpmY/pubhtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these 11 categories and 51 indicators</a>&nbsp;with which to assess the first set of potential Digital Public Goods.</p>



<p>The categories were:</p>



<ol><li>Licenses and Copyright</li><li>Utility and Impact</li><li>Benchmarks</li><li>Product Design</li><li>Product Quality</li><li>Community</li><li>Do No Harm</li><li>Best Practices</li><li>Content</li><li>Quality</li><li>Financial Sustainability</li></ol>



<h1 id="85bc">List of approved digital public goods for foundational literacy and early grade reading</h1>



<p>The projects below have been vetted against the criteria described above, in the first exercise of this kind for the Digital Public Goods Alliance. The assessment has been done by a group composed of experts from UNESCO, USAID, Creative Commons, ADEA, Mozilla, Education Development Center, Foundation for Learning Equality, the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, and Humans at Play. Some of the criteria, such as “license compliance with digital public goods requirements” are binary, whereas scores on others have been assessed in relation to one another, or information has been collected more for informational purposes.</p>



<p>The projects below were all approved by the expert group as meeting minimum criteria for digital public goods and we are continuing to adjust, expand and revise our structures for vetting as the Alliance continues to form. The Digital Public Goods Alliance is following up with several of the projects on improvement potential such as suggestions for improving accessibility, or for making licensing information more readily discoverable.</p>
