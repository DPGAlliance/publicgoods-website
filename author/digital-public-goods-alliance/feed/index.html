								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It has been a year since we launched the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">DPG Registry</a>, a repository that houses nominees and digital public goods. We are thrilled to announce this week that we have reached a milestone &#8212; <strong>500 nominations!&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>We would like to share our deepest gratitude with the advocates, owners, and maintainers who have made this possible by submitting nominations to the registry.</strong> These nominations account for an incredibly diverse set of open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content tackling real world issues &#8211; everything from sustainable farming to healthcare, from digital identity to vaccine coordination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People submit nominations to the registry for a variety of reasons including discoverability, recognition, and support. But, don’t take our word for it. Take it from the nominators themselves:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tor-Einar Skog, Senior Adviser at NIBIO shared that, “I&#8217;m proud to contribute software to help reach the UN Sustainable Development Goals”. NIBIO are creators of the open, online, free of charge forecast and information software for integrated management of pests, diseases and weeds, <a href="https://www.nibio.no/en/services/vips">VIPS</a> (now a digital public good). </p>



<p>Or, Pedro Reynolds-Cuellar, an educator and nominator who shared that, “[a]s with several other tools I used, I always thought about them as something people should have free access to. In the era of software, the idea of commons and communal benefit from the tools at our disposal takes a new meaning. In my mind, these nominations are an effort to bring forward tools that can benefit us all to a space where they can be found and highlighted.”</p>



<p>And, Martin Bedouret a developer from <a href="https://www.cboard.io/">Cboard</a>, a free web application for children and adults with speech and language impairments that facilitates communication with pictures and text-to-speech, who saw nominating their work as an opportunity to reach their goal by increasing the possibility for it to be found. “We want to reach many countries, and especially developing countries. The nomination will help us with this goal, as the platform is open and well prepared for international collaboration, we need visibility in order to reach out to collaborators and people who need a voice to communicate!”</p>



<p>Nominees, their creators, advocates and maintainers are at the core of everything we do. So, <strong>thank you for helping us reach this milestone!&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>While we’re thrilled to have gotten this far together, this is not the final destination. In fact, we are just getting started. Our ambition is for the DPG Registry to include hundreds, even thousands, more open nominees that advance the sustainable development goals.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>Why nominate to the DPG Registry</strong></h5>



<p>Nomination is the first step towards being recognised as a digital public good. Once a nomination is submitted, it is reviewed against the <a href="http://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">DPG Standard</a>, a baseline of 9-indicators that serve as a minimum standard that all digital public goods must meet. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FxCh3ylk8II8TWRG63uQ_kVXZnNrx828eZ6rUJE7VbuQwyYLTjmLP3kpY1HgO58CAN2ObRAx6C6KvhfyYCT05QakXvz-VLhobu5f5HnKIgF0k4gmNOqZEu6vvZnxbQPpcGxGoHwr" alt=""/></figure>



<p>So, what is the value in submitting a nomination to the DPG Registry?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>1) Discoverability&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Nominations and DPGs alike can be found on the DPG Registry. As an added bonus, the DPG Registry is partially compiled from, and feeds back into, partner systems like the <a href="https://solutions.dial.community/products">Catalog of Digital Solutions</a> maintained by the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL). This method of cross-pollination enhances discoverability and accelerates the likelihood of a nominee being found and adopted by organizations and governments looking for innovative solutions.</p>



<p><strong>2) Support for adoptability&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Digital public goods have clear documentation, open licenses, and follow standards and best practices that make them easy to adopt. We support nominees working to meet these standards. When nominating to the DPG Registry, projects can utilize <a href="https://resources.digitalpublicgoods.net/">DPG Resources</a>, a set of curated tools that assist them in becoming a digital public good. Additionally, our technical team helps nominees navigate which documentation or requirements are needed to ensure they not only meet the standard, but even surpass it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>3) Development impact</strong></p>



<p>It has been said that open source will be at the core of future international development efforts. We couldn’t agree more. As part of the digital transformation unfolding globally, governments and development agencies are reframing approaches to international development with a focus on creating and adapting open source projects. Submitting a nomination to become a digital public good signals alignment with&nbsp;the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and a commitment to making an impact. DPGs are a part of a growing network committed to open source principles that also respect privacy, strive to “do no harm”, and help attain the SDGs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>4) Becoming a Digital Public Good</strong></p>



<p>And finally, becoming a nominee is the first step toward being reviewed against the DPG Standard, and &#8211; if found to meet that standard &#8211; confirmed as a digital public good. Becoming a DPG provides exposure to development organizations including UNICEF and members of our communities of practice who review projects with high-impact potential so they can receive the support needed to be adopted by governments globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our ambition is to fill important gaps, ensure interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in to foster a flourishing ecosystem of digital public goods. Submitting a nomination is the first step to achieving this goal. <strong>Please consider </strong><a href="http://digitalpublicgoods.net/nominate/"><strong>submitting a nomination</strong></a><strong>, and be part of even larger milestones yet to come!&nbsp; </strong></p>

<h4><strong><em>Part I: Funding the technologies at the core</em></strong></h4>



<p><em>Even digital public goods that are in wide demand, and have proven their potential to address development needs in multiple countries, struggle to attract the contributions and financial support required to maintain and evolve over time. This blog considers how to change that through coordinated, sustainable grant funding. This is the first in a series of blogs exploring how to finance the digital public goods ecosystem.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>In the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) we believe that digital public goods (DPGs)* are essential to unlocking the full potential of digital technologies to enhance human welfare at scale. Their relevance to one or multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs), combined with their adoptability and adaptability, allows DPGs to strengthen international digital cooperation. Stakeholders can join forces to support solutions that address many of today’s greatest global challenges in critical areas such as health, education and climate change. DPGs are of particular importance for resource constrained countries looking to accelerate development through improving access to digital services.</p>



<p>Still, precisely due to their nature as “public goods” &#8211; which ensures that no one can prevent others from benefiting from them &#8211; DPGs can be difficult to fund through market mechanisms, and some of them should not have to prioritise generating profit.</p>



<p></p>



<h6><strong>Sustainable funding for the public good </strong></h6>



<p>The DPGA believes that DPGs with the highest potential to accelerate attainment of the SDGs in multiple countries should be sustainably funded in order to maximise the global public good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that sustainable grant funding is most critical for “infrastructural” DPGs that can be deployed as relevant parts of a country’s <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/accelerating-financial-inclusion-during-covid-19-and-beyond/">foundational or functional digital public infrastructures (DPIs)</a>. DPIs tend to be cross-sectorally enabling, serving as the rails that public and private service delivery can run on. They can therefore have a disproportionately positive impact on achieving the SDGs. Conversely, when DPIs are not well-designed and well-implemented, they can do harm to the economy and society. It is in the global public interest that they are built to serve society’s poor and marginalised groups, safeguard human rights, and enable a diverse and flourishing economic ecosystem. Stable grant funding for state-of-the-art infrastructural DPGs can help ensure this.</p>



<p></p>



<h6><strong>Building out ecosystems with infrastructural DPGs at the core</strong></h6>



<p>Sustainably funded infrastructural DPGs can become a reliable core for broader ecosystems through community building:</p>



<ul><li>For the <a href="https://www.mosip.io/">Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP)</a> core code management and evolution is fully funded by grants from a group of philanthropic and bilateral donors.** This enables the team responsible for managing and evolving the generic platform to focus exclusively on maximising utility for those the platform is designed to serve &#8211; in this case, countries in need of foundational digital identity systems.</li><li>Similarly backed by grant funding for core code development and maintenance, the team behind <a href="https://dhis2.org/">District Health Information Software 2</a> (DHIS2) has prioritised community building within and between the 70+ countries that have adopted the software, enabling countries to share improvements and related innovations. This is best exemplified by Sri Lanka, the first country in the world <a href="https://dhis2.org/sri-lanka-covid-surveillance/">to use DHIS2 for COVID-19 surveillance</a>, who shared this groundbreaking innovation with the global DHIS2 community. <a href="https://dhis2.org/covid-19/">Today</a>, this system is operational in 38 countries and is under development in fourteen more.</li><li>The data exchange layer <a href="https://x-road.global/">X-Road</a>, which is publicly funded by <a href="https://www.niis.org/">NIIS</a> members (currently Estonia and Finland), demonstrates how infrastructural DPGs can use community building to advance both the core technology and the  quality of downstream deployments. The <a href="https://x-road.global/community">X-Road Community</a> connects a diverse group of individuals and allows anyone to contribute to the open-source technology. This community-based support and knowledge-sharing helps local vendors around the world build the expertise needed to provide quality services to stakeholders adopting the technology.</li></ul>



<h6>More and better coordinated funding needed</h6>



<p>Since the creation of the DPGA in 2019, we have learned that while many stakeholders are individually doing great work that can help create a comprehensive and vibrant ecosystem built around infrastructural DPGs, it remains too limited and fragmented to usher in a paradigm shift. For that to happen, we must mobilise more resources both to strengthen existing financing instruments and to create new ones, while ensuring cross-coordination throughout different ecosystem-parts. The magnitude of this task is simply too large and complex in nature for any single entity to address all the challenges by itself.</p>



<p>As a multi-stakeholder alliance dedicated to the advancement of digital public goods, the DPGA is well placed to help build a partnership-oriented and coordinated funding model with infrastructural digital public goods at the core. We look forward to working with other stakeholders to shape this in the coming months. </p>



<h6><strong><em>The next part in this blog series</em></strong></h6>



<p><em>Funding infrastructural DPGs so that they can be built and maintained over time as generic “state-of-the art”, dependable and trustworthy technologies, is a critical first step to realising their full impact-potential. However, a sustainable funding model must also support countries to assess, implement and maintain DPGs. We will write about funding needs for country technical assistance in the next part of this blog series.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Throughout 2021 the Digital Public Goods Alliance will be undertaking a series of pathfinding pilots. These pilots are meant to increase the number of countries implementing DPGs, promote and support the creation of DPGs in low- and middle-income countries, and increase national capacity for implementing projects&nbsp;utilizing DPGs. Learnings and insights gained from these pathfinding pilots will strengthen future DPG deployments by helping to inform how they can best be implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pathfinding pilots must adhere to three criteria: 1) include local capacity building for creation of new DPGs, and/or adaptation and implementation of existing DPGs; 2) outcomes of the pilots must adhere to the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">DPG Standard</a>; and, 3) pilots must be conducted either in direct cooperation with and/or with the endorsement of a relevant government entity. </p>



<p><a href="http://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/#pathfinder-countries">Some of these pilots are already underway</a>. Below, we showcase the work of digital public goods DHIS2 and DHIS2 for Education as they, with support from Norway, launch pathfinding pilots in The Gambia and Uganda.</p>

<h3><strong>DHIS2 &#8211; A Digital Public Goods Case Study&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h6><strong><em>Digital Public Goods Introduction&nbsp;</em></strong></h6>



<p>Endorsed by the<a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/assets/pdf/Roadmap_for_Digital_Cooperation_EN.pdf"> UN Secretary General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>, the Digital Public Goods Alliance defines digital public goods (DPGs) as: “open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the SDGs.”</p>



<p>When operationalised, DPGs have proven to be much more. They have the ability to connect individuals and communities to vital services, improve data-based decision making capabilities, and build the infrastructure that societies rely on to respond to crises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA)’s mission is to aid the discovery, development, use of, and investment in DPGs. Amplifying success stories of DPGs to show their value, and highlighting implementation strategies from around the world is key to accelerating our mission. Strengthening understanding and awareness of DPGs is critical to fostering trust and interest in open source projects, and can help propel adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One success story is the free and open source platform <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/">DHIS2</a>, which is helping to attain the SDG’s in 73 low- and middle-income countries by supporting the management of education and health programs. </p>



<h6><strong><em>Background</em></strong></h6>



<p>From climate change to education, healthcare to transportation, digital public goods have the opportunity to solve some of society&#8217;s greatest challenges. This can be exemplified by District Health Information Software 2 (<a href="https://www.dhis2.org/">DHIS2</a>), an open-source software project first created to identify and address gaps in health data collection. The software has recently expanded to show value not just in the health sector, but in the education sector as well. DHIS2 was developed by the <a href="http://hisp.uio.no/">Health Information Systems Programme</a> (HISP) at the University of Oslo (UiO) in collaboration with partners in the Global South. It is shared for download at no cost and its open source software and source code is hosted on<a href="https://github.com/dhis2"> Github</a>.</p>



<p>The first version of this software, DHIS, began in 1998-99 fueled by the belief that collecting and layering granular data can help facilitate governments to make informed decisions. Initially, DHIS was developed to track routine monthly data from Primary Health Centers in Cape Town, South Africa.(1) <strong>Today, DHIS2 is the world&#8217;s largest health management information system (HMIS) platform, used in 73 low- and middle-income countries.</strong>(2) An astonishing 2.4 billion people, or 30% of the world&#8217;s population, live in countries where DHIS2 is used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last decade, DHIS2 has expanded beyond traditional HMIS reporting to include the collection of individual-level data feeding into shared health records including: lab results; disease surveillance; contact tracing and more. Seventy-seven countries and Indian states utilise the DHIS2 Tracker for case-based data entry, and 33 are using the DHIS2 Android app for data capture on mobile devices.(3)(4)</p>



<p>Proving its versatility beyond government ministries, DHIS2 is also used for data management by leading health organizations including Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization (WHO). As a Collaborating Center with WHO, the HISP team at the University of Oslo works with global and country experts to create downloadable standards-based configurations of the software for specific health domains, lowering the barrier to entry for many countries, and improving data quality within and across countries.(5)(6) </p>



<p><strong>Building on the same theory of change developed for expansion in the health sector, DHIS2 is two years into piloting “DHIS2 for Education”. </strong>Crucially, DHIS2 for Education builds on the existing DHIS software platform in countries where it is already deployed in the health sector to support the collection, analysis, visualization, and use of individual and aggregate data from institutions of learning.(7) This includes not just health and education data, but socioeconomic indicators as well that can help contextualize the health and education data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through these work streams, DHIS2 is directly addressing UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and 4 (Quality Education) which call for the use of data to guide improvement in both health and learning outcomes as well as equitable access to education. It also touches on a number of other SDGs including reducing inequality and eliminating poverty.&nbsp;</p>



<h6><strong><em>By the Numbers&nbsp;</em></strong></h6>



<ul><li>73 countries use DHIS2&nbsp;</li><li>5 countries use DHIS2 for Education</li><li>2.4 billion people live in places where DHIS2 is used</li><li>38 countries are using the software to combat COVID-19&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/15203526/Screenshot_2021-03-15-Covid-19-DHIS2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-808"/></figure>



<h6>&nbsp;<strong><em>Innovations&nbsp;</em></strong></h6>



<p>DHIS2 by the numbers alone is impressive, but that only tells part of the story. DHIS2 is a widely trusted platform that promotes holistic growth and impact by providing innovative solutions, including:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Accessibility</span></p>



<p>DHIS2 is both physically and financially accessible. It can capture data on computers, tablets and smartphones and most solutions work offline, enabling improved reach in locations with poor connectivity. The platform integrates easily with other software platforms bringing logistics, human resources, grading systems and payroll onto a single dashboard. DHIS2 is free to use aside from the cost of servers and internet connectivity and, because it is open source, it can be accessed and adapted to scenarios in any country.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capacity Building</span>&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure holistic, sustainable growth, and to combat brain drain, the<a href="http://www.dhis2.org/academy"> </a><a href="http://hisp.uio.no/">Health Information Systems Programme</a> (HISP) has built a community of users and experts in regions where DHIS2 is used through initiatives including the <a href="http://www.dhis2.org/academy">DHIS2 Academy</a> and <a href="https://community.dhis2.org/">DHIS2 Community of Practice</a>. As DHIS2 implementation varies based on local context, this also facilitates shared learnings and implementation strategies. </p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Versatility</span></p>



<p>“DHIS2 has a modular, layered architecture with a strong and open application programming interface (API).”(8) In practice, this means that native applications can run off of it. Currently, approximately 60 native applications do just that to perform different functions, and software developers can easily build their own external applications on top of DHIS2 making it more adaptable. DHIS2’s API also allows it to exchange data with other software, facilitating interoperability between systems. This agility means that DHIS2 teams can work closely with users or government representatives to explore different needs and scenarios that arise and adapt accordingly. </p>



<h6><strong><em>COVID-19 Response&nbsp;</em></strong></h6>



<p>DHIS2 has led projects that assist countries and regions responding to COVID-19. It has been evaluated as a leading digital solution for COVID-19 response by<a href="https://www.dhis2.org/covid-jhu-report"> Johns Hopkins University</a>, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/global-covid-19/compare-digital-tools.html">United State’s Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention</a> (CDC), and<a href="https://digitalsquare.org/covid19"> Digital Square</a>. Understanding their ability to quickly respond and adapt to growing health concerns, DHIS2 released a digital data package to accelerate case detection, reporting, surveillance and response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The package was inspired by the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health’s pioneering design of a DHIS2 tracker for COVID-19 which draws on years of <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/who">DHIS2 collaboration with the WHO</a> on designing standardized packages for key health programs. The tracker is operational in 38 countries and in development in 14 more.(9) In Uganda, for example, local health authorities are transmitting infection results digitally. In Rwanda, the health care system is fully digitalised, allowing data to arrive instantaneously.(10)&nbsp;</p>



<p>This innovation extends to the education sector as well. DHIS2 for Education uses an educational management information system (EMIS) that layers in health data and will provide long-term and sustainable responses to COVID-19 and other health challenges. One example is school-level vaccination campaigns which can synergize health and education data.</p>



<h6><strong><em>DHIS2 and Digital Public Goods Alliance Pathfinding&nbsp;</em></strong></h6>



<p>DHIS2 has been reviewed against the Digital Public Goods Standard, qualifying it as a digital public good which can be found on the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/dhis2.html">DPG Registry</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DHIS2 software is developed in line with the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principles/">Principles for Digital Development</a>, and it advances the SDGs in a number of ways. DHIS2 for Education is currently being deployed as an EMIS in several countries, facilitating effective communication between health and education programs (for example, vaccination campaigns targeting school-aged children), as well as supporting purely education-related goals like student enrollment and attendance, resource allocation, and infrastructure management. DHIS2 has identified opportunities to address and overcome similar challenges in both the health and education sectors such as data collection, where there is often no common approach to collecting valuable educational system data, such as human resource data for teachers or student’s tests results, that link with district or national systems. You can read more about this initiative here: <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/education">https://www.dhis2.org/education</a>.</p>



<p>Over the next three years the DHIS2 in Education pilot will be expanded. The pilot will focus on integration and scalable solutions in specific country contexts. It will draw from different regions with varying languages, norms, and traditions which will help shape its ability to respond to different countries with different needs.</p>



<p>Norway, a founding member of the DPGA, has been a funder of DHIS2 since 1994 and will partner with them to use this extended pilot as one of the key pathfinding cases for the DPGA. Pathfinding pilots help inform the development and roll out of DPGs for future use cases. Supporting this effort is of strategic importance to Norway’s efforts to highlight how DPGs developed for one sector can be relevant for other sectors, and hence help break down silos in international development cooperation. </p>



<h6><strong><em>Conclusion&nbsp;</em></strong></h6>



<p>DHIS2 exemplifies the power and potential of digital public goods. Not only has it successfully scaled in market, it has done so in a way that brings us closer to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Additionally, its development has been holistic and localisable, allowing countries to leverage their existing capacity and expertise. And, DHIS2 has adapted to various sectors and challenges including scaling for COVID-19 response and addressing challenges in education. </p>



<p>From its beginnings in Cape Town, DHIS2 has grown to significantly cover health data and information, and now education. It is this opportunity to break the silos of development, and address challenges holistically, that is particularly interesting to us at the DPGA.

<p>While, like many, we were eager to end 2020 and look towards the new year with new energy, it is important to take time to reflect on the achievements made, the challenges overcome, and the opportunities presented in 2020. </p>



<p>For the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA), reflecting on 2020 actually begins with our roots &#8211; the 2019 United Nations Secretary-General’s <a href="https://www.un.org/en/pdfs/DigitalCooperation-report-for%20web.pdf">High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation report</a> calling for the establishment of a broad, multi-stakeholder alliance, to facilitate access to and use of digital public goods. In December 2019 the DPGA was launched to answer that call, which meant kicking off 2020 with a lot of momentum.</p>



<p>Throughout 2020 significant steps were taken to support and accelerate the discovery and development of digital public goods that tackle real world challenges. We started the year off with two main goals, (1) establishing the foundations of the DPGA as a strategic entity with the potential for long-term impact and sustainability and, (2) to produce valuable outputs with immediate utility for the DPG ecosystem.</p>



<p>With these two goals in mind, and strengthened by the June 2020 <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">Roadmap on Digital Cooperation</a>, the DPGA achieved significant milestones in 2020.  Here is an overview of our top four achievements: </p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h6><strong>1. Defining Digital Public Goods</strong></h6>



<p>The DPGA coordinated with other stakeholders to provide input to the definition of digital public goods that was published by the UN Secretary-General in the 2020 Roadmap. This definition contributes to a universal understanding of what constitutes a digital public good, laying the groundwork for how the DPGA can support open projects. </p>



<p>Building off this momentum, the DPGA thereafter operationalised the digital public goods definition into the <a href="http://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">DPG Standard</a>, a set of nine indicators that comprise a comprehensive and shared assessment criteria for identifying projects as digital public goods. This standard is itself an open project and has benefited from several iterations. The DPGA is thankful to the communities and individuals that have helped support its development by contributing their thoughts and endorsements including CHAOSS, Creative Commons, DIAL, and Mozilla. The DPG Standard has also been featured by the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/global-cooperation-governmental-open-source">Open Source Observatory</a> and <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/12/digital-public-goods">opensource.org</a>. </p>



<h6><strong>2. Launching the DPG Registry</strong></h6>



<p>The DPGA mission includes promoting the discovery of digital public goods<em>.</em> To that end, in 2020 the DPGA significantly evolved the<em> </em><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">DPG Registry, </a>which started as a prototype in early 2019. Today, the DPG Registry contains 471 nominated projects, and 20 verified digital public goods that have been assessed against the DPG Standard. </p>



<p>Our work relies on the ethos of open source. So, in December 2020 we launched a community sourcing experiment asking for public participation to review nominated open projects against the DPG Standard with the ultimate goal of distributing and expediting the process of determining if a project qualifies as a digital public good. This experiment will run through January 2021 and has already had engagement from teachers, students, tech practitioners, and many more. We continue to invite public participation in the experiment at <a href="https://validate.digitalpublicgoods.net/">validate.digitalpublicgoods.net</a>.</p>



<h6><strong>3. Engaging Experts in Sector Specific Communities</strong></h6>



<p>In 2020 the DPGA began facilitating Communities of Practice (CoPs). CoPs convene thematic experts with the aim of identifying, assessing and&nbsp; advancing high-impact potential projects that work towards the attainment of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Thus far, CoPs have focused on technologies for enhancing Early Grade Reading skills, Financial Inclusion, Digital Health, and Climate Change Adaptation. These groups include more than 60 experts from 40+ different institutions including NGOs, governments, think tanks, international banks, and funders. </p>



<p>In 2020 the CoPs began making an impact. In November, we released a <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/DPGA-Paper_Accelerating_Financial_Inclusion.pdf">paper</a> on the relationship between digital public infrastructures (DPIs) and DPGs, and the particular relevance of their intersection for driving financial inclusion. In addition, an assessment of nine early grade reading <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/announcing-the-first-vetted-digital-public-goods-for-foundational-literacy-and-early-grade-reading/">projects</a> was completed. 2021 will take the efforts of the CoPs even further.</p>



<h6><strong>4. Launching Country Engagement Pilots</strong></h6>



<p>Eager to document and share learnings that can help facilitate the impactful implementation of digital public goods, in late 2020, the DPGA developed an initial approach for piloting country engagements in low- and middle-income countries. In 2021 we will begin deploying short-term pilot activities in partnership with DPGA co-founders.</p>

<p> No 2020 year-in-review would be complete without a reflection on the challenges we all faced as a result of the global pandemic. While COVID-19 brought near-insurmountable challenges, it also illustrated how digital technologies can both create and prevent inequities, ultimately highlighting the need for countries to accelerate digital transformation. The need for quality digital public goods that are accessible, adaptable, and deployable is clearer than ever. </p>



<p>The increasing awareness of COVID-19’s long-term economic impact added urgency to international conversations about digital public infrastructures, <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/dpg-alliance-and-the-digitaldecade/">sparking new energy</a> and interest in understanding, assessing, and promoting digital public goods with the potential for countries to deploy as part of their&nbsp; digital foundations. </p>



<p>In 2021 we hope to capitalise on our early successes and build on the momentum in the DPG ecosystem. There is more clarity now than ever before on the urgency of digital transformation and we have a unique opportunity to scale up international cooperation around digital public goods. </p>
