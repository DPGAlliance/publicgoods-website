Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDKâs IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \n Onaâs Preference for Beam: \n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFiâs ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["We have measures to support GDPR compliance in place but none of the privacy laws listed affect our implementations yet.

Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy \u0026 security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX.

The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean.

After the administrator gets acquainted with the provided information about the state of the facility, compares the description of accessibility with the provided photos and/ or videos, the updated and / or supplemented version of the facility card will appear in the system. Users can also confirm the description of the facility if they believe that all the information about it is filled in correctly. \n -Thirdly, disclaimers can be found on the platform that we do not give any guarantee regarding the accuracy of information about facilities displayed on the map and we are not responsible for this. We also warn users that normative legal acts are often edited, and we ask the users to check whether the acts remain valid by means of searching them on the information and legal system of normative legal acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan âAdiletâ or in the information system âPARAGRAPHâ."},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"Yes","typesOfDataCollected":["Full name","Email","Phone number","Gender","Health data","Region of residence"],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"We collect and use personal data solely for the purposes specified in the privacy policy: to combat spam and protect the users against harassment and hate speech, as well as to keep in touch with the users, in particular to send notifications, requests, responses regarding usage of the portal, provision of services, processing of requests and applications from the users. \nWe restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents.

Understand the Existing Ecosystem: We work directly with local ministries of health, observe how other local data systems are integrated in local workflows, and share data transparently within the health data ecosystem in countries (e.g. we integrate with DHIS2 in 3 countries, we adopted the India National Health ID, etc.)","3. Design for Scale: We are currently at mid-size scale (5000 facilities, 1.4M patients) and have designed a scalable system that grow 10-100x this scale. We work with local public health implementation partners to scale the growth in terms of user support and cost effectiveness. We have solid technical growth plans in place to handle many more patients. We scale training plans that have enabled WHO-India to add over 1000 facilities in a single month.","4. Be Data Driven: We are extremely data drive, combining qualitative research with quant to give a fuller picture. The key is that Simple drives rational, timely feedback loops back into the health system by surfacing the key data to answer the question: 'Are patients enrolled in the hypertension control program getting healthier?' This sounds basic, but is the heart of the program and significantly lacking from many public health programs.","5. Reuse and Improve: We take lessons from older health programs, we integrate with existing systems (e.g. DHIS2), and we adopt existing standards (e.g. FHIR).","6. Address Privacy \u0026 Security: We take privacy and security seriously by conducting twice-yearly 3rd party security audits, adopting standard security protocols, and adhering carefully to all local privacy regulations.","7.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Design with the User \n With the general public, LGUs, policymakers, and public health officials as intended target users of AEDES, we developed the application on a user-friendly web interface for ease of accessibility. We have presented this to WHO Philippines and we have gotten feedback from a healthcare professional on how and what to improve in the application.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem \n Dengue is already an existing public health problem not only in the Philippines and but also in many Asian and Latin American countries. As the product needs to be improved further, we are working with other researchers and scoping for funding opportunities.","3. Design for Scale \n We are now closely working with other researchers to further improve AEDES. We want to expand the functionalities of AEDES and incorporate a dengue risk index. We have used the MVC Framework (Model, View, Controller) which isolates application functionality into self-contained components. We also utilized the API from Sentinel Copernicus Satellites to  get satellite images with vast date ranges.","4. Build for Sustainability \n Since the data captured is from global and public remote sensing service, the application can continue gathering data. There is a plan to create a social enterprise around the dengue prediction service, by incorporating other risk frameworks, we can generalize the process and ensure that other indicators will also be integrated. The results and/or insights will be offered on a subscription basis.","5. Be Data Driven \n Data, as it moves along its value chain from creation to actionable insights, underpins the overall workflow of AEDES. Also, by leveraging the three main disciplines of analytics - Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive, AEDES facilitates a holistic approach to dengue prevention and control and empowers its intended users to make informed decisions.","6. Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation \n AEDES was built through an open innovation challenge by NASA, we also advocate the use of Open Source technologies such as Python, PHP for tools, QGIS for geospatial analysis,  Sentinel Copernicus Satellites for data, and government sources for weather and health-related data. AEDES prototype is also publicly hosted 24/7 for free. We welcome collaborators to improve and provide feedback to the AEDES implementation.","7. Reuse and Improve \n AEDES at its core was developed by reusing prior work by other researchers. By combining three research papers related to using social listening, stagnant water detection, and dengue prediction we have developed the application. We are planning on using other research to integrate risk frameworks to improve the current workflow of AEDES.","8. Address Privacy \u0026 Security \n We dont collect, store, or transfer any personal information. AEDES website also uses HTTPS (Positive SSL) for website security.","9. Be Collaborative \n The team has expanded since winning the hackathon and have been closely working with dengue researchers and experts (Dr. Thaddeus Carvajal, Wilson Chua, and Dr. Michael Promentilla).

During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019, the main user cases were tested by Oky's target users. \n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars, colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example, in Indonesia, encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal \u0026 invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. Itâs theory of change includes scaling. In addition, Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition, there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Okyâs privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards, open source. \n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance, both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI, as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition, to comply with W3C privacy standards, the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also, as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English, Bahasa, Mongolian and some more to be coming too), it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian, Latin alphabet etc.","Finally, to keep user's data safe, Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials. This includes encryption of data and penetration testing (amongst other methods) to ensure there are no vulnerabilities in the system and potential data leaks. "]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"1. The Oky app has been designed with very high privacy settings, to protect users. We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Okyâs strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device.\n2. The app has also been designed to be discrete (based on user feedback) so that it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that it is a period tracker - it has a discrete icon, the interface does not look like a traditional period tracker app (for anyone looking over a userâs shoulder), and it will only send discrete messages to users via the push notification from CMS. For example, messages will never be sent that give away personal information that others may see. The Do-No-Harm principle is imperative. For example, messages like 'your period is late, you might be pregnant' would never be sent.\n3. Users require a passcode to access their account on the app, to protect their account and information (especially for users who may share phones). They are required to enter their passcode every time they open the app; this is the default. Users also set up a  memorable question and answer if they lose their passcode, but this cannot be reset from the backend if users forget it, to protect user data.\n4. Content has been created and vetted by experts, and some content (eg quizzes and did you knows) has had age-restrictions added for users aged 15 (according to their account profile) and below. This is to protect younger users from content that may not be deemed age appropriate (and that they cannot control seeing, as the quizzes appear at random).\n5.

Typically this is with foundational ID systems (e.g. National ID) and health systems (e.g. DHIS2). This feature of interoperability is very important as the universal data set of birth and deaths can help ensure government services are inclusive.\nNational ID: OpenCRVS can integrate with any National ID system in order to reliably validate the existence of NID numbers provided during civil registration applications as well as reduce the time spent on the application form itself by pulling data from the NID system and auto-populate form fields.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can be integrated with a National ID system in a number of ways, depending on system capabilities. Current use cases include:\n- To validate the existence of a NID number\n- To auto-populate the form with data from the NID field to minimise required effort from registration staff\n- To create a National ID for a new registration when the event occurs.\nHealth: Births and deaths often occur in health facilities and those that occur in the community can be dealt with by health staff at the community level. These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an 'in-progress' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Kiva Protocol offers an alternative approach to digital identity management that can provide real benefits to women.  An open-source authentication platform, Kiva Protocol enables individuals to store a version of their identity documents in a digital wallet that they control, providing them with a highly secure and portable digital record.

Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDKâs IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \n Onaâs Preference for Beam: \n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFiâs ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["We have measures to support GDPR compliance in place but none of the privacy laws listed affect our implementations yet.

The service was not developed with these directly in mind, but our process still fit well with many of these principles (which is reassuring both for the principles and Met Norway Weather):","I. Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy \u0026 security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX. Be collaborative. \n - Building the service is continuously done through a close collaboration between IT personnel and geoscience researchers (meteorological and computational co-design). \n - The interface to the service was created in close collaboration with important users of our service."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"We keep traffic logs with ip-addresses, and these logs can probably be considered as some kind of personal data.

Given an ecosystem that includes periodic health surveys as well as numerous other non-health interactions, MERON was designed to take the valuable data collected in health surveys and make non-health interactions useful as a malnutrition screening opportunity. Additionally, care was taken to protect dignity and be culturally aware through less invasive techniques than are currently standard.","Design for scale: MERON is designed to improve as adoption increases, with near-instantaneous results at scale for field users.","Build for Sustainability: Once trained, the MERON application runs with very minimal overhead, and with the proper partnership the project can sustainably run and improve itself with low cost.","Be data driven: MERON is meant to generate the critical insights that are currently difficult to gather through health monitoring surveys alone. MERON will drive down the cost of data, making it practicable to use in estimating malnutrition impacts and informing interventions.","Use open standards, open data, open source, and open innovation: The MERON code is open source, leverages open projects and standards. The only protected information is individual health data, which must be secured to ensure privacy and dignity.","Reuse and Improve: MERON is designed to reuse the valuable truth data collected through health surveys and improve it such that a quick smartphone photo can screen for malnutrition in non-health related contexts.","Address privacy and security: MERON secures individualâs private information and only uses this information for model training purposes. Use of the MERON application results only in individual private results that are not shared or exposed in a way that puts any individuals at risk.","Be collaborative: Kimetricaâs vision for MERON is as a capability that is operated as a common good for all.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDKâs IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \n Onaâs Preference for Beam: \n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFiâs ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["We have measures to support GDPR compliance in place but none of the privacy laws listed affect our implementations yet.

The service was not developed with these directly in mind, but our process still fit well with many of these principles (which is reassuring both for the principles and Met Norway Weather):","I. Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy \u0026 security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX.

People registries for entitlements, donor registries in health, establishment registries such as hospitals, schools, etc, company registry, device registries, vehicle registries, credential registries for digital locker like solutions, plat/animal registries; farmer, FPO, and agricultural registries; family registries; MSME \u0026 micro-entrepreneur registries for access to credit; registry of gig-economy workers (blue-collar workers, drivers, delivery agents, etc) for transferable verifiable work history; student registry for holistic progress card and interoperable learning credentials; school and teacher registry with quality indicators, etc are examples from the real world. Idea of decentralized registries, attestations for higher trust, issuance of credentials, etc are truly fundamental building blocks for any digital transformation project.  All digital platforms require master data and actor (person/entity/thing) data related to that system to be maintained for identification, validation, etc. As the world becomes data rich, it is essential that various data about people, entities, geographies, resources, assets, etc. are made available in electronic registries with Open APIs for other applications to seamlessly validate and use attested and authenticated data. This is even more critical when it comes to people and entities where various claims can be electronically validated against such registries via open APIs avoiding paper based validations, thus increasing trust while decreasing cost of validation.  An interoperable and unified registry infrastructure needs to be built to enable \"live\", \"reusable\", âlinkedâ, and âtrustworthyâ registries are key to any large scale societal transformation.  Sunbird RC, as a generalized building block, is used to create The Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination Open Credentialing (DIVOC) solution to support countries with their vaccination effort. DIVOC builds on top of  Sunbird RC to digitize the generation of a vaccination certificate available both in electronic form and printable copy downloaded from the central vaccination database. Governments across the world (India, Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc) have used DIVOC (built using Sunbird RC) to roll-out digital vaccination platforms.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

We have presented this to WHO Philippines and we have gotten feedback from a healthcare professional on how and what to improve in the application.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem \n Dengue is already an existing public health problem not only in the Philippines and but also in many Asian and Latin American countries. As the product needs to be improved further, we are working with other researchers and scoping for funding opportunities.","3. Design for Scale \n We are now closely working with other researchers to further improve AEDES. We want to expand the functionalities of AEDES and incorporate a dengue risk index. We have used the MVC Framework (Model, View, Controller) which isolates application functionality into self-contained components. We also utilized the API from Sentinel Copernicus Satellites to  get satellite images with vast date ranges.","4. Build for Sustainability \n Since the data captured is from global and public remote sensing service, the application can continue gathering data. There is a plan to create a social enterprise around the dengue prediction service, by incorporating other risk frameworks, we can generalize the process and ensure that other indicators will also be integrated. The results and/or insights will be offered on a subscription basis.","5. Be Data Driven \n Data, as it moves along its value chain from creation to actionable insights, underpins the overall workflow of AEDES. Also, by leveraging the three main disciplines of analytics - Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive, AEDES facilitates a holistic approach to dengue prevention and control and empowers its intended users to make informed decisions.","6. Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation \n AEDES was built through an open innovation challenge by NASA, we also advocate the use of Open Source technologies such as Python, PHP for tools, QGIS for geospatial analysis,  Sentinel Copernicus Satellites for data, and government sources for weather and health-related data. AEDES prototype is also publicly hosted 24/7 for free. We welcome collaborators to improve and provide feedback to the AEDES implementation.","7. Reuse and Improve \n AEDES at its core was developed by reusing prior work by other researchers. By combining three research papers related to using social listening, stagnant water detection, and dengue prediction we have developed the application. We are planning on using other research to integrate risk frameworks to improve the current workflow of AEDES.","8. Address Privacy \u0026 Security \n We dont collect, store, or transfer any personal information. AEDES website also uses HTTPS (Positive SSL) for website security.","9. Be Collaborative \n The team has expanded since winning the hackathon and have been closely working with dengue researchers and experts (Dr. Thaddeus Carvajal, Wilson Chua, and Dr. Michael Promentilla).

Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars, colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \n 1.

Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal \u0026 invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. Itâs theory of change includes scaling. In addition, Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition, there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe.

For instance, both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI, as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition, to comply with W3C privacy standards, the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also, as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English, Bahasa, Mongolian and some more to be coming too), it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian, Latin alphabet etc.","Finally, to keep user's data safe, Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials.

"]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"1. The Oky app has been designed with very high privacy settings, to protect users. We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Okyâs strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device.\n2. The app has also been designed to be discrete (based on user feedback) so that it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that it is a period tracker - it has a discrete icon, the interface does not look like a traditional period tracker app (for anyone looking over a userâs shoulder), and it will only send discrete messages to users via the push notification from CMS. For example, messages will never be sent that give away personal information that others may see. The Do-No-Harm principle is imperative. For example, messages like 'your period is late, you might be pregnant' would never be sent.\n3. Users require a passcode to access their account on the app, to protect their account and information (especially for users who may share phones). They are required to enter their passcode every time they open the app; this is the default. Users also set up a  memorable question and answer if they lose their passcode, but this cannot be reset from the backend if users forget it, to protect user data.\n4.

Our Terms of Use also indicate clearly that we donât permit our clients to use non-CE-certified headsets. Also, our user instructions explicitly mention the maximum duration of allowable continuous operation on a VR headset with a single user/child which specifically addresses the overheating concern. Finally, we recommend to our clients a wide spectrum of alternatives, with regards to VR headsets, on which we test all our VR modules prior to product delivery. \n- Hardware-Software compatibility: We should always make sure that the developed software is compatible with the processor of the headset in terms of computational efficiency. Otherwise, the content would be poorly rendered with noticeable flickering, which impacts the user experience remarkably and biases the results. Since we develop the curriculum in house, we recommend to the clients the headsets on which the curriculum is tested by our team. Moreover, to mitigate this risk, we provide our product on a wide variety of headsets, with a wide range of costs, mainly to give the client the flexibility of choice according to their budget and accepted experience quality. \n\nOperational Risks \n- Potential dizziness effects on users: Our safety policy and user instructions strictly mentions that our system is not allowed to be used without a physically-existing supervisor. If the sessions are taking place on-premises so the specialist is the supervisor, and if the session is taking place at home, so the specialist is supervising remotely but a guardian is accompanying the child physically. This is mainly to remove the headset in case dizziness has been observed. Also, our user instructions explicitly mentions the maximum duration of allowable usage on a VR headset with a single user/child which addresses the dizziness concern. Finally, we only adopt VR headsets with explicit dizziness instructions for the users including Oculus, Pico, and Gear VR. \n- Potential habituation if not enough scenarios are developed and used: Our product plan takes into consideration the development of an ever-growing library of modules that takes into account the diversity of interests, social scenarios, acceptable difficulty levels, and the age range.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

An essential feature of human-centered design is that it prioritizes the dignity and agency of end users. It is also explicitly iterative and takes responsibility for making adaptations to address any potential unintended effects of a system - such as a situation in which health workers might experience grief or abuse from a peer or supervisor via their digital tool.

Create user personas: was undertaken at inception point. The UI/UX designer in collaboration with the Oky team created profiles of the target audience. \n2. Develop and validate user scenarios: test cases where written which cover main user journeys and scenarios. During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019, the main user cases were tested by Oky's target users. \n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars, colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example, in Indonesia, encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal \u0026 invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. Itâs theory of change includes scaling. In addition, Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition, there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Okyâs privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards, open source. \n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance, both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI, as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition, to comply with W3C privacy standards, the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also, as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English, Bahasa, Mongolian and some more to be coming too), it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian, Latin alphabet etc.","Finally, to keep user's data safe, Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials. This includes encryption of data and penetration testing (amongst other methods) to ensure there are no vulnerabilities in the system and potential data leaks. "]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"1. The Oky app has been designed with very high privacy settings, to protect users. We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Okyâs strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device.\n2. The app has also been designed to be discrete (based on user feedback) so that it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that it is a period tracker - it has a discrete icon, the interface does not look like a traditional period tracker app (for anyone looking over a userâs shoulder), and it will only send discrete messages to users via the push notification from CMS. For example, messages will never be sent that give away personal information that others may see. The Do-No-Harm principle is imperative. For example, messages like 'your period is late, you might be pregnant' would never be sent.\n3. Users require a passcode to access their account on the app, to protect their account and information (especially for users who may share phones). They are required to enter their passcode every time they open the app; this is the default. Users also set up a  memorable question and answer if they lose their passcode, but this cannot be reset from the backend if users forget it, to protect user data.\n4. Content has been created and vetted by experts, and some content (eg quizzes and did you knows) has had age-restrictions added for users aged 15 (according to their account profile) and below. This is to protect younger users from content that may not be deemed age appropriate (and that they cannot control seeing, as the quizzes appear at random).\n5.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Develop and validate user scenarios: test cases where written which cover main user journeys and scenarios. During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019, the main user cases were tested by Oky's target users. \n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars, colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example, in Indonesia, encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal \u0026 invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. Itâs theory of change includes scaling. In addition, Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition, there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Okyâs privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards, open source. \n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance, both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI, as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition, to comply with W3C privacy standards, the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also, as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English, Bahasa, Mongolian and some more to be coming too), it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian, Latin alphabet etc.","Finally, to keep user's data safe, Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials.

We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Okyâs strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device.\n2. The app has also been designed to be discrete (based on user feedback) so that it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that it is a period tracker - it has a discrete icon, the interface does not look like a traditional period tracker app (for anyone looking over a userâs shoulder), and it will only send discrete messages to users via the push notification from CMS. For example, messages will never be sent that give away personal information that others may see. The Do-No-Harm principle is imperative. For example, messages like 'your period is late, you might be pregnant' would never be sent.\n3. Users require a passcode to access their account on the app, to protect their account and information (especially for users who may share phones). They are required to enter their passcode every time they open the app; this is the default. Users also set up a  memorable question and answer if they lose their passcode, but this cannot be reset from the backend if users forget it, to protect user data.\n4. Content has been created and vetted by experts, and some content (eg quizzes and did you knows) has had age-restrictions added for users aged 15 (according to their account profile) and below. This is to protect younger users from content that may not be deemed age appropriate (and that they cannot control seeing, as the quizzes appear at random).\n5.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens. Protecting privacy and securing data are key themes in the design of OpenG2P."},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["- OpenG2P components are flexible to be used within country specific privacy laws.","- The OpenG2P framework confers privacy, security, and consent as an inalienable right of every person regardless of their gender and economic situation.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

The service was not developed with these directly in mind, but our process still fit well with many of these principles (which is reassuring both for the principles and Met Norway Weather):","I. Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy \u0026 security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX. Be collaborative. \n - Building the service is continuously done through a close collaboration between IT personnel and geoscience researchers (meteorological and computational co-design). \n - The interface to the service was created in close collaboration with important users of our service."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"We keep traffic logs with ip-addresses, and these logs can probably be considered as some kind of personal data.

The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean.

Additionally, care was taken to protect dignity and be culturally aware through less invasive techniques than are currently standard.","Design for scale: MERON is designed to improve as adoption increases, with near-instantaneous results at scale for field users.","Build for Sustainability: Once trained, the MERON application runs with very minimal overhead, and with the proper partnership the project can sustainably run and improve itself with low cost.","Be data driven: MERON is meant to generate the critical insights that are currently difficult to gather through health monitoring surveys alone. MERON will drive down the cost of data, making it practicable to use in estimating malnutrition impacts and informing interventions.","Use open standards, open data, open source, and open innovation: The MERON code is open source, leverages open projects and standards. The only protected information is individual health data, which must be secured to ensure privacy and dignity.","Reuse and Improve: MERON is designed to reuse the valuable truth data collected through health surveys and improve it such that a quick smartphone photo can screen for malnutrition in non-health related contexts.","Address privacy and security: MERON secures individualâs private information and only uses this information for model training purposes. Use of the MERON application results only in individual private results that are not shared or exposed in a way that puts any individuals at risk.","Be collaborative: Kimetricaâs vision for MERON is as a capability that is operated as a common good for all.

Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDKâs IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \n Onaâs Preference for Beam: \n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFiâs ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["We have measures to support GDPR compliance in place but none of the privacy laws listed affect our implementations yet.

The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons.

A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees.

Also, our user instructions explicitly mention the maximum duration of allowable continuous operation on a VR headset with a single user/child which specifically addresses the overheating concern. Finally, we recommend to our clients a wide spectrum of alternatives, with regards to VR headsets, on which we test all our VR modules prior to product delivery. \n- Hardware-Software compatibility: We should always make sure that the developed software is compatible with the processor of the headset in terms of computational efficiency. Otherwise, the content would be poorly rendered with noticeable flickering, which impacts the user experience remarkably and biases the results.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens. Protecting privacy and securing data are key themes in the design of OpenG2P."},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["- OpenG2P components are flexible to be used within country specific privacy laws.","- The OpenG2P framework confers privacy, security, and consent as an inalienable right of every person regardless of their gender and economic situation.

Tamper resistant logging of system access should be implemented across all potential routes of attacks","OpenG2P blocks by default not on externally-accessible networks.

The next step is obtaining a status of Digital Public Good as a pathfinding pilot project run by UNICEF in Kazakhstan. As a potential future direction of development, we consider using artificial intelligence in the information system. In addition to cooperation with UNICEF, close interaction with site users and recipients of the benefits should be noted: the ability to supplement and amend the map is open to all registered users. Thus, the project encourages the activity of civil society and increases the level of individual responsibility for accessible, safe and comfortable public space. We take into account suggestions from users to improve the map (regarding the interface, new additional functions and sections on the site, etc.). A version of the website for people with low vision is also available."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"- Demonstrating the level of accessibility of public facilities, one should take into account that, for example, a person in a wheelchair can not enter a cafe without a ramp, but a person with low vision can.

Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy \u0026 security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX.

to the Principles for Digital Development, the summary below describes how VIPS has integrated best practices into technology-enabled development programs for international development and cooperation:","1. Design with the user: The system has been designed and evolved during the past 20 years in close collaboration with the Norwegian Agricultural Advisory service. Workshops with farmers have been held several times during this period, where feedback has led to improvements and new features.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem: In addition to the Norwegian advisors; farmers, researchers and advisors in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Lihtuania, Latvia, Switzerland, Bosnia-Hercegovina and India have been consulted. Through various international projects, the needs and the potential for VIPS have been clarified.","3. Design for Scale - Build for Sustainability: The system is funded on a long-term basis in Norway for Norwegian users. The system may be installed anywhere else as well, given that the resources are available. The system is simple, flexible and modular, allowing for scaling in almost any situation imaginable.","4. Open Standards: VIPS is Open Source and uses standards wherever possible in order to make communication between VIPS and external systems as easy as possible.","5. Reuse and Improve: By using Open Source software for building and as APIs/dependencies of the project, only the functionality specific of VIPS has been developed uniquely for the project.","6. Privacy \u0026 Security: Has been described in other parts of the DPG form.","7. Be Collaborative: Collaboration on development of models and the VIPS platform is made easy by the plug-in design for models and the clear separation of the system parts (micro/medium services loosely coupled). In fact, the latest version of VIPS was designed to relieve pest prediction model developers of the work of creating the infrastructure needed to make the model available to users across the globe. The system is also designed to cooperate with 3rd party systems to the greatest extent possible."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"VIPS uses the https protocol to ensure safe communication between the user and the system. \n VIPS requires authentication to edit data.

Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy \u0026 security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX. Be collaborative. \n - Building the service is continuously done through a close collaboration between IT personnel and geoscience researchers (meteorological and computational co-design). \n - The interface to the service was created in close collaboration with important users of our service."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"We keep traffic logs with ip-addresses, and these logs can probably be considered as some kind of personal data.

Design with the user: The system has been designed and evolved during the past 20 years in close collaboration with the Norwegian Agricultural Advisory service. Workshops with farmers have been held several times during this period, where feedback has led to improvements and new features.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem: In addition to the Norwegian advisors; farmers, researchers and advisors in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Lihtuania, Latvia, Switzerland, Bosnia-Hercegovina and India have been consulted. Through various international projects, the needs and the potential for VIPS have been clarified.","3. Design for Scale - Build for Sustainability: The system is funded on a long-term basis in Norway for Norwegian users. The system may be installed anywhere else as well, given that the resources are available. The system is simple, flexible and modular, allowing for scaling in almost any situation imaginable.","4. Open Standards: VIPS is Open Source and uses standards wherever possible in order to make communication between VIPS and external systems as easy as possible.","5. Reuse and Improve: By using Open Source software for building and as APIs/dependencies of the project, only the functionality specific of VIPS has been developed uniquely for the project.","6. Privacy \u0026 Security: Has been described in other parts of the DPG form.","7. Be Collaborative: Collaboration on development of models and the VIPS platform is made easy by the plug-in design for models and the clear separation of the system parts (micro/medium services loosely coupled). In fact, the latest version of VIPS was designed to relieve pest prediction model developers of the work of creating the infrastructure needed to make the model available to users across the globe. The system is also designed to cooperate with 3rd party systems to the greatest extent possible."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"VIPS uses the https protocol to ensure safe communication between the user and the system. \n VIPS requires authentication to edit data.

Typically this is with foundational ID systems (e.g. National ID) and health systems (e.g. DHIS2). This feature of interoperability is very important as the universal data set of birth and deaths can help ensure government services are inclusive.\nNational ID: OpenCRVS can integrate with any National ID system in order to reliably validate the existence of NID numbers provided during civil registration applications as well as reduce the time spent on the application form itself by pulling data from the NID system and auto-populate form fields.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can be integrated with a National ID system in a number of ways, depending on system capabilities. Current use cases include:\n- To validate the existence of a NID number\n- To auto-populate the form with data from the NID field to minimise required effort from registration staff\n- To create a National ID for a new registration when the event occurs.\nHealth: Births and deaths often occur in health facilities and those that occur in the community can be dealt with by health staff at the community level. These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an 'in-progress' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems.

See https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/keyFeatures which shows features that facilitate inclusion and aim to mitigate the risk that individuals are disadvantaged because they are not registered in the civil registry."},"inappropriateIllegalContent":{"collectStoreDistribute":"No","type":"","contentFilter":"","policyGuidelinesDocumentationLink":"","illegalContentDetection":"","illegalContentDetectionMechanism":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"userInteraction":"No","addressSafetySecurityUnderageUsers":"","stepsAddressRiskPreventSafetyUnderageUsers":[""],"griefAbuseHarassmentProtection":"","harassmentProtectionSteps":[""]}},"locations":{"developmentCountries":{"GBR":"United Kingdom","ZAF":"South Africa","BGD":"Bangladesh"},"deploymentCountries":{"BGD":"Bangladesh"}},"aliases":["Open Civil Registration and Vital Statistics"],"description":"OpenCRVS is an open-source software for civil registration, designed for low resource settings","website":"https://www.opencrvs.org/","license":[{"spdx":"MPL-2.0","licenseURL":"https://www.opencrvs.org/license"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":16,"evidenceText":"OpenCRVS is a digital public good to help achieve universal civil registration and evidence-based decision making in all country contexts.\nOpenCRVS was created in direct response to: \nSDG Goal/Target 16.9: \"By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration\"\nIndicator: Proportion of children under 5 years whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age\n addition (as of March 2017), 67 of the 230 SDG indicators can be measured effectively by using data derived from well-functioning CRVS systems, in particular for the numerators (births, deaths) and denominators (total population, live births, total deaths).

Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy \u0026 security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX.

Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees.

Mitigation: As demonstrated in the video above, the Notesmaster platform has developed an online peer review system that allows all stakeholders to contribute to a sustainable multiplier effect, leading to growing number of digital resources. These digital lessons can be copied and reversioned, then submitted for peer review by the local community. \n Risk: Impersonation of Teachers by students. Mitigation: The platform is designed in such away that persons impersonating teachers can do little harm. They are not able to achieve a position of influence over their peers through impersonation.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

An essential feature of human-centered design is that it prioritizes the dignity and agency of end users.

Current use cases include:\n- To validate the existence of a NID number\n- To auto-populate the form with data from the NID field to minimise required effort from registration staff\n- To create a National ID for a new registration when the event occurs.\nHealth: Births and deaths often occur in health facilities and those that occur in the community can be dealt with by health staff at the community level. These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an 'in-progress' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems. Although not currently a recognised standard, we hope that these extensions become de-facto standards over time as their implementation becomes more widespread."],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"Our mobile application and microservices are secure, protected by 2-Factor Authentication utilising OAuth JWT best practices. Our privacy policy can be found here: https://www.plan.org.au/privacy-policy/\nIn order to understand and mitigate the risks (particularly for children) within a digital civil registration system, the project created âIdentifying and addressing risks to children in digitised birth registration systems: a step-by-step guideâ. (https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Children/BirthRegistrationMarginalized/PlanInternationalGeneva_4.pdf) If not anticipated, digital civil registration systems can present a number of child protection threats:\n- Identity theft or fraud\n- Privacy violation\n- Targeting based on personal characteristics\n- Personal security violation or exploitation\n- Exclusion from the benefits of birth registration\nThe risk assessment tool, which forms part of this guide, should be used in collaboration with any OpenCRVS implementation to ensure these and other risks are identified and mitigated against. OpenCRVS has been designed specifically for low resource settings and to overcome the barriers typically seen in countries where birth and death registration is low. See https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/keyFeatures which shows features that facilitate inclusion and aim to mitigate the risk that individuals are disadvantaged because they are not registered in the civil registry."},"inappropriateIllegalContent":{"collectStoreDistribute":"No","type":"","contentFilter":"","policyGuidelinesDocumentationLink":"","illegalContentDetection":"","illegalContentDetectionMechanism":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"userInteraction":"No","addressSafetySecurityUnderageUsers":"","stepsAddressRiskPreventSafetyUnderageUsers":[""],"griefAbuseHarassmentProtection":"","harassmentProtectionSteps":[""]}},"locations":{"developmentCountries":{"GBR":"United Kingdom","ZAF":"South Africa","BGD":"Bangladesh"},"deploymentCountries":{"BGD":"Bangladesh"}},"aliases":["Open Civil Registration and Vital Statistics"],"description":"OpenCRVS is an open-source software for civil registration, designed for low resource settings","website":"https://www.opencrvs.org/","license":[{"spdx":"MPL-2.0","licenseURL":"https://www.opencrvs.org/license"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":16,"evidenceText":"OpenCRVS is a digital public good to help achieve universal civil registration and evidence-based decision making in all country contexts.\nOpenCRVS was created in direct response to: \nSDG Goal/Target 16.9: \"By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration\"\nIndicator: Proportion of children under 5 years whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age\n addition (as of March 2017), 67 of the 230 SDG indicators can be measured effectively by using data derived from well-functioning CRVS systems, in particular for the numerators (births, deaths) and denominators (total population, live births, total deaths).
