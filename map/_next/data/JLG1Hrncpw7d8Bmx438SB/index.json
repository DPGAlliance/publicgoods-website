It was the first independent initiative to work on this issue and was launched in December 2010 by a founding group of four women together with tech partners, advisers, and volunteers. It generated mass public dialogue, pushed the National Council for Women and several members of parliament to draft new laws, inspired a first successful court case, and encouraged women's NGOs who had previously been reluctant to take on this issue, to form an 18 member NGO Task Force on Sexual Harassment. In an independent review (https://www.ushahidi.com/in-action/towards-a-safer-city) of Harassmap.org, they concluded that the Ushahidi map is an effective tool for data collection for sensitive issues, encouraging more participation and sometimes more truthful reports than other typical data collection means.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

We have presented this to WHO Philippines and we have gotten feedback from a healthcare professional on how and what to improve in the application.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem \n Dengue is already an existing public health problem not only in the Philippines and but also in many Asian and Latin American countries. As the product needs to be improved further, we are working with other researchers and scoping for funding opportunities.","3. Design for Scale \n We are now closely working with other researchers to further improve AEDES. We want to expand the functionalities of AEDES and incorporate a dengue risk index. We have used the MVC Framework (Model, View, Controller) which isolates application functionality into self-contained components. We also utilized the API from Sentinel Copernicus Satellites to  get satellite images with vast date ranges.","4. Build for Sustainability \n Since the data captured is from global and public remote sensing service, the application can continue gathering data. There is a plan to create a social enterprise around the dengue prediction service, by incorporating other risk frameworks, we can generalize the process and ensure that other indicators will also be integrated. The results and/or insights will be offered on a subscription basis.","5. Be Data Driven \n Data, as it moves along its value chain from creation to actionable insights, underpins the overall workflow of AEDES. Also, by leveraging the three main disciplines of analytics - Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive, AEDES facilitates a holistic approach to dengue prevention and control and empowers its intended users to make informed decisions.","6. Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation \n AEDES was built through an open innovation challenge by NASA, we also advocate the use of Open Source technologies such as Python, PHP for tools, QGIS for geospatial analysis,  Sentinel Copernicus Satellites for data, and government sources for weather and health-related data. AEDES prototype is also publicly hosted 24/7 for free. We welcome collaborators to improve and provide feedback to the AEDES implementation.","7. Reuse and Improve \n AEDES at its core was developed by reusing prior work by other researchers.

Create user personas: was undertaken at inception point. The UI/UX designer in collaboration with the Oky team created profiles of the target audience. \n2. Develop and validate user scenarios: test cases where written which cover main user journeys and scenarios. During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019, the main user cases were tested by Oky's target users. \n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars, colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example, in Indonesia, encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal & invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. It’s theory of change includes scaling. In addition, Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition, there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Oky’s privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards, open source. \n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance, both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI, as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition, to comply with W3C privacy standards, the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also, as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English, Bahasa, Mongolian and some more to be coming too), it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian, Latin alphabet etc.","Finally, to keep user's data safe, Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials. This includes encryption of data and penetration testing (amongst other methods) to ensure there are no vulnerabilities in the system and potential data leaks. "]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"1. The Oky app has been designed with very high privacy settings, to protect users. We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Oky’s strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device.\n2. The app has also been designed to be discrete (based on user feedback) so that it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that it is a period tracker - it has a discrete icon, the interface does not look like a traditional period tracker app (for anyone looking over a user’s shoulder), and it will only send discrete messages to users via the push notification from CMS. For example, messages will never be sent that give away personal information that others may see. The Do-No-Harm principle is imperative. For example, messages like 'your period is late, you might be pregnant' would never be sent.\n3. Users require a passcode to access their account on the app, to protect their account and information (especially for users who may share phones). They are required to enter their passcode every time they open the app; this is the default. Users also set up a  memorable question and answer if they lose their passcode, but this cannot be reset from the backend if users forget it, to protect user data.\n4. Content has been created and vetted by experts, and some content (eg quizzes and did you knows) has had age-restrictions added for users aged 15 (according to their account profile) and below. This is to protect younger users from content that may not be deemed age appropriate (and that they cannot control seeing, as the quizzes appear at random).\n5.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Design with the user: The system has been designed and evolved during the past 20 years in close collaboration with the Norwegian Agricultural Advisory service. Workshops with farmers have been held several times during this period, where feedback has led to improvements and new features.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem: In addition to the Norwegian advisors; farmers, researchers and advisors in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Lihtuania, Latvia, Switzerland, Bosnia-Hercegovina and India have been consulted. Through various international projects, the needs and the potential for VIPS have been clarified.","3. Design for Scale - Build for Sustainability: The system is funded on a long-term basis in Norway for Norwegian users. The system may be installed anywhere else as well, given that the resources are available. The system is simple, flexible and modular, allowing for scaling in almost any situation imaginable.","4. Open Standards: VIPS is Open Source and uses standards wherever possible in order to make communication between VIPS and external systems as easy as possible.","5. Reuse and Improve: By using Open Source software for building and as APIs/dependencies of the project, only the functionality specific of VIPS has been developed uniquely for the project.","6. Privacy & Security: Has been described in other parts of the DPG form.","7. Be Collaborative: Collaboration on development of models and the VIPS platform is made easy by the plug-in design for models and the clear separation of the system parts (micro/medium services loosely coupled). In fact, the latest version of VIPS was designed to relieve pest prediction model developers of the work of creating the infrastructure needed to make the model available to users across the globe.

Sunbird Obsrv can be utilized as an independent building block by adopters or as part of a system that employs other Sunbird building blocks. Sunbird Obsrv comes with a set of microservices, APIs, and some utility SDKs to make it easy for adopters to rapidly enable powerful data processing and aggregation infrastructure to process telemetry data, validate telemetry stream data, as well as aggregate and generate actionable insights via APIs. It also has built-in open data cataloging and publishing capability.

All digital platforms require master data and actor (person/entity/thing) data related to that system to be maintained for identification, validation, etc. As the world becomes data rich, it is essential that various data about people, entities, geographies, resources, assets, etc. are made available in electronic registries with Open APIs for other applications to seamlessly validate and use attested and authenticated data. This is even more critical when it comes to people and entities where various claims can be electronically validated against such registries via open APIs avoiding paper based validations, thus increasing trust while decreasing cost of validation.  An interoperable and unified registry infrastructure needs to be built to enable \"live\", \"reusable\", “linked”, and “trustworthy” registries are key to any large scale societal transformation.  Sunbird RC, as a generalized building block, is used to create The Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination Open Credentialing (DIVOC) solution to support countries with their vaccination effort. DIVOC builds on top of  Sunbird RC to digitize the generation of a vaccination certificate available both in electronic form and printable copy downloaded from the central vaccination database. Governments across the world (India, Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc) have used DIVOC (built using Sunbird RC) to roll-out digital vaccination platforms.  In addition, Sunbird RC is also used in the digital infrastructure for India’s education."}],"sectors":["Digital/Data/Tech"],"type":["software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core"}],"organizations":[{"name":"EkStep Foundation","website":"https://www.ekstep.org","org_type":"owner","contact_name":"Deepika Mogilishetty","contact_email":"info@ekstep.org"}],"stage":"DPG","search":"dpg"},{"name":"Bisa Health","clearOwnership":{"isOwnershipExplicit":"Yes","copyrightURL":"https://bisaapp.com/"},"platformIndependence":{"mandatoryDepsCreateMoreRestrictions":"No","isSoftwarePltIndependent":"","pltIndependenceDesc":""},"documentation":{"isDocumentationAvailable":"Yes","documentationURL":["API usage: http://bisaapp.com/open-source/","Explore endpoints: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZwiRPuOUEDZkbglaKw5wK53WQ7tVxAL7/edit"]},"NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","checkNonPIIAccessMechanism":"","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["The Bisa Mobile Application is conscious of the sensitivity of the information/data it handles and is therefore committed to maintaining the confidence and trust with respect to the privacy of its users. \n The following laws of Ghana are applicable with respect to the Bisa Mobile Application and we are committed to adhering to them:-","Electronic Communications Act, 2008 (Act 775)","Electronic Communications Regulations, 2011 (L.I. 1991)","Credit Reporting Act, 2007 (Act 726)","Public Health Act, 2012 (Act 851)","Children’s Act, 1998 (Act 560)","Reference: https://bisaapp.com/legal-data-privacy-laws/"],"adherenceSteps":["Privacy policy - https://bisaapp.com/privacy-policy/"]},"standards":{"supportStandards":"Yes","standardsList":["ISO 13131:2021"],"evidenceStandardSupport":[""],"implementBestPractices":"Yes","bestPracticesList":["Principles For Digital Development"]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"All doctors are certified professionals recommended by the Ghana Health Service (GHS)."},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"Yes","typesOfDataCollected":["Name","Email","Phone Number","Address","Date of birth","Known/existing medical condition"],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"Bisa has features like anonymous login for users to easily ask questions without keeping any user data. \n Users are given system generated names to ensure anonymity."},"inappropriateIllegalContent":{"collectStoreDistribute":"No","type":"","contentFilter":"","policyGuidelinesDocumentationLink":"","illegalContentDetection":"","illegalContentDetectionMechanism":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"userInteraction":"Yes","addressSafetySecurityUnderageUsers":"Yes","stepsAddressRiskPreventSafetyUnderageUsers":["All doctors are certified professionals recommended by the Ghana Health Service (GHS).","Users are given system generated names to ensure anonymity"],"griefAbuseHarassmentProtection":"Yes","harassmentProtectionSteps":["All content on the Bisa Platform (Articles / tips) are verified health information from the Ghana Health Service (GHS)."]}},"locations":{"developmentCountries":{"GHA":"Ghana"},"deploymentCountries":{"GHA":"Ghana","SEN":"Senegal"}},"aliases":["Bisa"],"description":"Bisa is a health application that allows the public to receive health information and communicate with doctors.","website":"https://bisaapp.com","license":[{"spdx":"MIT","licenseURL":"https://github.com/BisaMhealth/BisaApp/blob/backend/LICENSE"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":3,"evidenceText":"Bisa health platform allows the public access to doctors and receive healthcare information through their mobile devices (both smart and non-smart phones).

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Design with the User \n With the general public, LGUs, policymakers, and public health officials as intended target users of AEDES, we developed the application on a user-friendly web interface for ease of accessibility. We have presented this to WHO Philippines and we have gotten feedback from a healthcare professional on how and what to improve in the application.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem \n Dengue is already an existing public health problem not only in the Philippines and but also in many Asian and Latin American countries. As the product needs to be improved further, we are working with other researchers and scoping for funding opportunities.","3. Design for Scale \n We are now closely working with other researchers to further improve AEDES. We want to expand the functionalities of AEDES and incorporate a dengue risk index. We have used the MVC Framework (Model, View, Controller) which isolates application functionality into self-contained components. We also utilized the API from Sentinel Copernicus Satellites to  get satellite images with vast date ranges.","4. Build for Sustainability \n Since the data captured is from global and public remote sensing service, the application can continue gathering data. There is a plan to create a social enterprise around the dengue prediction service, by incorporating other risk frameworks, we can generalize the process and ensure that other indicators will also be integrated. The results and/or insights will be offered on a subscription basis.","5. Be Data Driven \n Data, as it moves along its value chain from creation to actionable insights, underpins the overall workflow of AEDES. Also, by leveraging the three main disciplines of analytics - Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive, AEDES facilitates a holistic approach to dengue prevention and control and empowers its intended users to make informed decisions.","6. Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation \n AEDES was built through an open innovation challenge by NASA, we also advocate the use of Open Source technologies such as Python, PHP for tools, QGIS for geospatial analysis,  Sentinel Copernicus Satellites for data, and government sources for weather and health-related data. AEDES prototype is also publicly hosted 24/7 for free. We welcome collaborators to improve and provide feedback to the AEDES implementation.","7. Reuse and Improve \n AEDES at its core was developed by reusing prior work by other researchers. By combining three research papers related to using social listening, stagnant water detection, and dengue prediction we have developed the application. We are planning on using other research to integrate risk frameworks to improve the current workflow of AEDES.","8. Address Privacy & Security \n We dont collect, store, or transfer any personal information. AEDES website also uses HTTPS (Positive SSL) for website security.","9. Be Collaborative \n The team has expanded since winning the hackathon and have been closely working with dengue researchers and experts (Dr. Thaddeus Carvajal, Wilson Chua, and Dr. Michael Promentilla).

During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019, the main user cases were tested by Oky's target users. \n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars, colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example, in Indonesia, encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal & invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. It’s theory of change includes scaling. In addition, Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition, there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Oky’s privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards, open source. \n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance, both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI, as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition, to comply with W3C privacy standards, the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also, as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English, Bahasa, Mongolian and some more to be coming too), it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian, Latin alphabet etc.","Finally, to keep user's data safe, Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials.

We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Oky’s strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device.\n2. The app has also been designed to be discrete (based on user feedback) so that it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that it is a period tracker - it has a discrete icon, the interface does not look like a traditional period tracker app (for anyone looking over a user’s shoulder), and it will only send discrete messages to users via the push notification from CMS. For example, messages will never be sent that give away personal information that others may see. The Do-No-Harm principle is imperative. For example, messages like 'your period is late, you might be pregnant' would never be sent.\n3. Users require a passcode to access their account on the app, to protect their account and information (especially for users who may share phones). They are required to enter their passcode every time they open the app; this is the default. Users also set up a  memorable question and answer if they lose their passcode, but this cannot be reset from the backend if users forget it, to protect user data.\n4.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens. Protecting privacy and securing data are key themes in the design of OpenG2P."},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["- OpenG2P components are flexible to be used within country specific privacy laws.","- The OpenG2P framework confers privacy, security, and consent as an inalienable right of every person regardless of their gender and economic situation.

Create user personas: was undertaken at inception point. The UI/UX designer in collaboration with the Oky team created profiles of the target audience. \n2. Develop and validate user scenarios: test cases where written which cover main user journeys and scenarios. During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019, the main user cases were tested by Oky's target users. \n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars, colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example, in Indonesia, encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal & invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. It’s theory of change includes scaling. In addition, Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition, there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Oky’s privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards, open source. \n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance, both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI, as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition, to comply with W3C privacy standards, the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also, as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English, Bahasa, Mongolian and some more to be coming too), it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian, Latin alphabet etc.","Finally, to keep user's data safe, Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials.

We do not hold in our database any personally identifiable data. While user-generated fields at time of registration (username, password, secure answer) are not able to identify an individual, as part of Oky’s strict data governance approach, Oky hashes and salts these fields to render the original values inaccessible. This hashing approach is used with the purpose to: (a) obfuscate the username to anyone who might access the database, and (b) to guarantee user authentication, ie. to allow users to log into their account on the same device or a different device.\n2. The app has also been designed to be discrete (based on user feedback) so that it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that it is a period tracker - it has a discrete icon, the interface does not look like a traditional period tracker app (for anyone looking over a user’s shoulder), and it will only send discrete messages to users via the push notification from CMS. For example, messages will never be sent that give away personal information that others may see. The Do-No-Harm principle is imperative. For example, messages like 'your period is late, you might be pregnant' would never be sent.\n3. Users require a passcode to access their account on the app, to protect their account and information (especially for users who may share phones). They are required to enter their passcode every time they open the app; this is the default. Users also set up a  memorable question and answer if they lose their passcode, but this cannot be reset from the backend if users forget it, to protect user data.\n4. Content has been created and vetted by experts, and some content (eg quizzes and did you knows) has had age-restrictions added for users aged 15 (according to their account profile) and below. This is to protect younger users from content that may not be deemed age appropriate (and that they cannot control seeing, as the quizzes appear at random).\n5.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

All digital platforms require master data and actor (person/entity/thing) data related to that system to be maintained for identification, validation, etc. As the world becomes data rich, it is essential that various data about people, entities, geographies, resources, assets, etc. are made available in electronic registries with Open APIs for other applications to seamlessly validate and use attested and authenticated data. This is even more critical when it comes to people and entities where various claims can be electronically validated against such registries via open APIs avoiding paper based validations, thus increasing trust while decreasing cost of validation.  An interoperable and unified registry infrastructure needs to be built to enable \"live\", \"reusable\", “linked”, and “trustworthy” registries are key to any large scale societal transformation.  Sunbird RC, as a generalized building block, is used to create The Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination Open Credentialing (DIVOC) solution to support countries with their vaccination effort. DIVOC builds on top of  Sunbird RC to digitize the generation of a vaccination certificate available both in electronic form and printable copy downloaded from the central vaccination database. Governments across the world (India, Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc) have used DIVOC (built using Sunbird RC) to roll-out digital vaccination platforms.  In addition, Sunbird RC is also used in the digital infrastructure for India’s education."}],"sectors":["Digital/Data/Tech"],"type":["software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core"}],"organizations":[{"name":"EkStep Foundation","website":"https://www.ekstep.org","org_type":"owner","contact_name":"Deepika Mogilishetty","contact_email":"info@ekstep.org"}],"stage":"DPG","search":"dpg"},{"name":"FAO Digital Services Portfolio - E-Nutrifood","clearOwnership":{"isOwnershipExplicit":"Yes","copyrightURL":"http://www.fao.org/digital-agriculture/digital-portfolio/en/"},"platformIndependence":{"mandatoryDepsCreateMoreRestrictions":"No","isSoftwarePltIndependent":"","pltIndependenceDesc":""},"documentation":{"isDocumentationAvailable":"Yes","documentationURL":["https://digital.apps.fao.org/e-nutrifood/categories"]},"NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","checkNonPIIAccessMechanism":"","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["PRIVACY POLICY FOR USE OF FAO APPLICATIONS: http://www.fao.org/contact-us/privacy-policy/en/"],"adherenceSteps":["http://www.fao.org/contact-us/terms/en/"]},"standards":{"supportStandards":"Yes","standardsList":["REST API","JSON","HTTPS"],"evidenceStandardSupport":[""],"implementBestPractices":"Yes","bestPracticesList":["Principles For Digital Development","Human Centered Design Principles","Progressive Web App (PWA)"]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"http://www.fao.org/contact-us/privacy-policy/en/"},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"No","typesOfDataCollected":[""],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, FAO employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. \nExcept for authorized investigations and to maintain required correspondence files, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens. Protecting privacy and securing data are key themes in the design of OpenG2P."},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["- OpenG2P components are flexible to be used within country specific privacy laws.","- The OpenG2P framework confers privacy, security, and consent as an inalienable right of every person regardless of their gender and economic situation.

Sunbird RC adopters may configure their Sunbird RC based registry instance to collect PII or non-PII and hence Sunbird RC has implemented many best practices to keep user data safe and secure such as attribute visibility, user consent, data security, etc.","Management of PII/non-PII data in Sunbird RC is purely a “highly extensible/configurable/non-opinionated open-software solution”, and it’s source code lies in GitHub (Sunbird RC is not a ‘hosted service or product’).

While the Sunbird RC technical architecture has taken privacy and security controls into consideration as default implementation, it is up to the Implementers/Adopters to establish a privacy policy at their end to cover the various implementation scenarios (e.g. management & sharing of PII/non PII data)."],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"Management of PII/non-PII data in Sunbird RC is purely a “highly extensible/configurable/non-opinionated open-software solution”, and it’s source code lies in GitHub (Sunbird RC is not a ‘hosted service or product’).

It was the first independent initiative to work on this issue and was launched in December 2010 by a founding group of four women together with tech partners, advisers, and volunteers. It generated mass public dialogue, pushed the National Council for Women and several members of parliament to draft new laws, inspired a first successful court case, and encouraged women's NGOs who had previously been reluctant to take on this issue, to form an 18 member NGO Task Force on Sexual Harassment. In an independent review (https://www.ushahidi.com/in-action/towards-a-safer-city) of Harassmap.org, they concluded that the Ushahidi map is an effective tool for data collection for sensitive issues, encouraging more participation and sometimes more truthful reports than other typical data collection means.

to the Principles for Digital Development, the summary below describes how VIPS has integrated best practices into technology-enabled development programs for international development and cooperation:","1. Design with the user: The system has been designed and evolved during the past 20 years in close collaboration with the Norwegian Agricultural Advisory service. Workshops with farmers have been held several times during this period, where feedback has led to improvements and new features.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem: In addition to the Norwegian advisors; farmers, researchers and advisors in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Lihtuania, Latvia, Switzerland, Bosnia-Hercegovina and India have been consulted. Through various international projects, the needs and the potential for VIPS have been clarified.","3. Design for Scale - Build for Sustainability: The system is funded on a long-term basis in Norway for Norwegian users. The system may be installed anywhere else as well, given that the resources are available. The system is simple, flexible and modular, allowing for scaling in almost any situation imaginable.","4. Open Standards: VIPS is Open Source and uses standards wherever possible in order to make communication between VIPS and external systems as easy as possible.","5. Reuse and Improve: By using Open Source software for building and as APIs/dependencies of the project, only the functionality specific of VIPS has been developed uniquely for the project.","6. Privacy & Security: Has been described in other parts of the DPG form.","7. Be Collaborative: Collaboration on development of models and the VIPS platform is made easy by the plug-in design for models and the clear separation of the system parts (micro/medium services loosely coupled). In fact, the latest version of VIPS was designed to relieve pest prediction model developers of the work of creating the infrastructure needed to make the model available to users across the globe.

Design with the user: The system has been designed and evolved during the past 20 years in close collaboration with the Norwegian Agricultural Advisory service. Workshops with farmers have been held several times during this period, where feedback has led to improvements and new features.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem: In addition to the Norwegian advisors; farmers, researchers and advisors in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Lihtuania, Latvia, Switzerland, Bosnia-Hercegovina and India have been consulted. Through various international projects, the needs and the potential for VIPS have been clarified.","3. Design for Scale - Build for Sustainability: The system is funded on a long-term basis in Norway for Norwegian users. The system may be installed anywhere else as well, given that the resources are available. The system is simple, flexible and modular, allowing for scaling in almost any situation imaginable.","4. Open Standards: VIPS is Open Source and uses standards wherever possible in order to make communication between VIPS and external systems as easy as possible.","5. Reuse and Improve: By using Open Source software for building and as APIs/dependencies of the project, only the functionality specific of VIPS has been developed uniquely for the project.","6. Privacy & Security: Has been described in other parts of the DPG form.","7. Be Collaborative: Collaboration on development of models and the VIPS platform is made easy by the plug-in design for models and the clear separation of the system parts (micro/medium services loosely coupled). In fact, the latest version of VIPS was designed to relieve pest prediction model developers of the work of creating the infrastructure needed to make the model available to users across the globe.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.
