RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication. PKI governs the issuance of digital certificates to protect sensitive data, provide unique digital identities for users, devices, and applications, and secure end-to-end communications. \n- Reveals’ infrastructure ís protected and encapsulated within a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Access to these components is governed via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), implementing the OpenVPN protocol. OpenVPN is an open-source VPN that is commonly used for creating Point-to-Point and Site-to-Site connections. It uses a traditional security protocol based on the  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. \n - Data transmission between Reveal Android client and Reveal Server is protected by the TLS encryption protocol. The Transport Layer Security  (TLS) generates an encrypted connection where the Android client acts as the client and user access is prohibited to specific applications instead of the entire network. \n - Data at rest on the Reveal Android client is encrypted using the AES256-SIV-CMAC encryption standard. \n Reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noQM0B5cGr2tq344zPrB-Yz-c5j0DyPDEGzIzhQ9VRA/edit"},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"Yes","typesOfDataCollected":["Firstname","Lastname","Age","Geographic Location"],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"Server security and encryption - The Reveal servers uphold all security standards for storage of PII including appropriate encryption processes and access restrictions."},"inappropriateIllegalContent":{"collectStoreDistribute":"No","type":"","contentFilter":"","policyGuidelinesDocumentationLink":"","illegalContentDetection":"","illegalContentDetectionMechanism":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"userInteraction":"No","addressSafetySecurityUnderageUsers":"","stepsAddressRiskPreventSafetyUnderageUsers":[""],"griefAbuseHarassmentProtection":"","harassmentProtectionSteps":[""]}},"locations":{"developmentCountries":{"ZMB":"Zambia","ZAF":"South Africa"},"deploymentCountries":{"ZMB":"Zambia","KEN":"Kenya","SEN":"Senegal","NGA":"Nigeria","MLI":"Mali"}},"aliases":[""],"description":"Reveal is a Digital Global Good that uses spatial intelligence to drive delivery of life-saving interventions.","website":"https://revealprecision.com/","license":[{"spdx":"Apache-2.0","licenseURL":"https://github.com/akrosinc/reveal-server/blob/main/LICENSE"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":1,"evidenceText":"Reveal supports microplanning and mobilization of resources, including basic social services, financial aid, or food aid.

Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.

Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas.

Currently we live in a technological age where children and adolescents live a normality that consists of the use of technological tools. They get bored easily, the way in which information is presented to them is not very motivating and school is no longer the only means of access to education. There are different tools through which they can acquire knowledge, however the minimum has a pedagogical basis. Due to the aforementioned, we must innovate in the teaching-learning process. Currently there are new teaching methodologies, with a focus on active learning and the development of skills through play. One of these methodologies is gamification. Different authors define it as a process in which game mechanisms are used to attract people, promote learning and solve problems. The purpose is to motivate the player's behavior. Elements in the game such as points, avatars or levels, increase the psychological predisposition of the player to continue in it. This makes gamification an ally of education. Currently there are game developers who use platforms like Godot, however they do not have the pedagogical knowledge to add elements that help the user to consolidate their learning. That's why Pixframe Studios is developing a plugin for the Godot Engine: a tool to help new game developers and serious game teams create new games with the goal of aiding in the development of education. As mentioned before, Latin America is still trying to develop new tools to improve their educational field, nevertheless they don't have enough knowledge nor tools to achieve it. The plugin is open source so that the community in Latin America can access new ways of creating video games with a pedagogical basis. In this way, code is created, optimized and shared. Educational material can be shared in an innovative way and finally a stock of illustrative material is generated such as button icons, backgrounds for games, fonts and unique Godot Engine assets."}],"sectors":["Education"],"type":["software"],"repositories":[{"name":"towi","url":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot"}],"organizations":[{"name":"Pixframe Studios","website":"https://pixframestudios.com/","org_type":"owner","contact_name":"David Casillas","contact_email":"dc@pixframestudios.com"}],"stage":"DPG","search":"dpg"},{"name":"Trimester Save Afriyie","clearOwnership":{"isOwnershipExplicit":"Yes","copyrightURL":"https://trimestersave.com/"},"platformIndependence":{"mandatoryDepsCreateMoreRestrictions":"No","isSoftwarePltIndependent":"","pltIndependenceDesc":""},"documentation":{"isDocumentationAvailable":"Yes","documentationURL":["API documentation - https://tms-crm-backend.herokuapp.com/api-docs/v1","Backend - https://github.com/Trimester-Save-Ltd/tms-afriyie-backend","Frontend - https://github.com/Trimester-Save-Ltd/tms-afriyie-frontend","https://trimester-save.herokuapp.com/"]},"NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","checkNonPIIAccessMechanism":"","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["Data Protection Commission Ghana"],"adherenceSteps":["https://github.com/Trimester-Save-Ltd/tms-afriyie-backend/blob/main/Terms%20of%20Service%20and%20Privacy%20Policy.md"]},"standards":{"supportStandards":"Yes","standardsList":["HTML","CSS","REST","JSON","JavaScript"],"evidenceStandardSupport":["https://github.com/Trimester-Save-Ltd/tms-afriyie-backend"],"implementBestPractices":"Yes","bestPracticesList":["Design with the user","Use Open Standards, Open Data and Open Source and Open Innovation","Address Privacy and Security","Understand the Existing Ecosystem","Design for scale"]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"The TMS Afriyie app demonstrates and it is designed not to cause any harm to the user and the app's design is considered user friendly."},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"Yes","typesOfDataCollected":["The application collects and stores:","Personal information such as: name, telephone number, spouse name, spouse phone number, email address, identification card, demographic (city, town, country, address)","Personal budgeting information","Medical vitals - blood pressure, weight, glucose level, last cycle date"],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"The project also took steps to ensure that the data collected are secured in cloud based databases (Postgres)  and using modules that secure HTTP headers (Helmet) to prevent intruders from grabbing information easily.

For Harmony, new integrations will tend to inform how visualizations, dashboards, and analyses need to function, and changes to those components might inform how the integration pipeline should change as well. Within Harmony, the full feature set of the product is immediately available to users once data is integrated. Therefore, users will not have to wait until different phases of the project to begin interacting with data once the data integration pipeline is created. Instead, users can immediately begin analyzing data, creating reports, building dashboards, validating results, providing feedback and making decisions. User feedback is collected and requirements are incorporated back into the Project Library (a comprehensive knowledge management resource), spurring a new round of development. Agile development at Zenysis ensures that users are involved at every stage of development and results in a product that is tightly aligned with evolving user needs.  Harmony was also developed in line with the Principles of Digital Development, including designing the software with the user in mind and building it for sustainability. The Harmony platform software was built with technical best practices at its core. Best practices include:  Cross-browser compatibility:  The platform supports Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox   Mobile web and responsive web design:  While the platform is optimized for desktop computers, the platform interface is responsive and features are reasonably available on mobile devices.   Internationalization:  The platform supports writing systems outside of the Latin alphabet (all UTF-8 characters, not just those designated LATIN). The project is built with a robust translation and localization library that enables users to translate any content.

Excerpt from Devex Article: “Zenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,” John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. “This model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda’s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis’ approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. “We attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,” said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. “We’ve had some partners pull out, saying: ‘Our time here has elapsed.

With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times.

For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0).

Barriers to inclusion and participation are exacerbated by the lack of access to affordable, relevant assistive technology. According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in people with disabilities engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability. Digital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure 'no one is left behind' in our increasingly digital world.

Typically this is with foundational ID systems (e.g. National ID) and health systems (e.g. DHIS2). This feature of interoperability is very important as the universal data set of birth and deaths can help ensure government services are inclusive.\nNational ID: OpenCRVS can integrate with any National ID system in order to reliably validate the existence of NID numbers provided during civil registration applications as well as reduce the time spent on the application form itself by pulling data from the NID system and auto-populate form fields.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can be integrated with a National ID system in a number of ways, depending on system capabilities. Current use cases include:\n- To validate the existence of a NID number\n- To auto-populate the form with data from the NID field to minimise required effort from registration staff\n- To create a National ID for a new registration when the event occurs.\nHealth: Births and deaths often occur in health facilities and those that occur in the community can be dealt with by health staff at the community level. These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an 'in-progress' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems.

Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDK’s IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \n Ona’s Preference for Beam: \n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFi’s ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["We have measures to support GDPR compliance in place but none of the privacy laws listed affect our implementations yet.

The service was not developed with these directly in mind, but our process still fit well with many of these principles (which is reassuring both for the principles and Met Norway Weather):","I. Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX. Be collaborative. \n - Building the service is continuously done through a close collaboration between IT personnel and geoscience researchers (meteorological and computational co-design). \n - The interface to the service was created in close collaboration with important users of our service."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"We keep traffic logs with ip-addresses, and these logs can probably be considered as some kind of personal data.

The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees.

Otherwise, the content would be poorly rendered with noticeable flickering, which impacts the user experience remarkably and biases the results. Since we develop the curriculum in house, we recommend to the clients the headsets on which the curriculum is tested by our team.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a global standard security framework built on a role-based permissions management model that manages access at both the broad and granular levels by aligning the assigned permissions role with the organizational role of the user. RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication. PKI governs the issuance of digital certificates to protect sensitive data, provide unique digital identities for users, devices, and applications, and secure end-to-end communications. \n- Reveals’ infrastructure ís protected and encapsulated within a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Access to these components is governed via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), implementing the OpenVPN protocol. OpenVPN is an open-source VPN that is commonly used for creating Point-to-Point and Site-to-Site connections. It uses a traditional security protocol based on the  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. \n - Data transmission between Reveal Android client and Reveal Server is protected by the TLS encryption protocol. The Transport Layer Security  (TLS) generates an encrypted connection where the Android client acts as the client and user access is prohibited to specific applications instead of the entire network. \n - Data at rest on the Reveal Android client is encrypted using the AES256-SIV-CMAC encryption standard. \n Reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noQM0B5cGr2tq344zPrB-Yz-c5j0DyPDEGzIzhQ9VRA/edit"},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"Yes","typesOfDataCollected":["Firstname","Lastname","Age","Geographic Location"],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"Server security and encryption - The Reveal servers uphold all security standards for storage of PII including appropriate encryption processes and access restrictions."},"inappropriateIllegalContent":{"collectStoreDistribute":"No","type":"","contentFilter":"","policyGuidelinesDocumentationLink":"","illegalContentDetection":"","illegalContentDetectionMechanism":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"userInteraction":"No","addressSafetySecurityUnderageUsers":"","stepsAddressRiskPreventSafetyUnderageUsers":[""],"griefAbuseHarassmentProtection":"","harassmentProtectionSteps":[""]}},"locations":{"developmentCountries":{"ZMB":"Zambia","ZAF":"South Africa"},"deploymentCountries":{"ZMB":"Zambia","KEN":"Kenya","SEN":"Senegal","NGA":"Nigeria","MLI":"Mali"}},"aliases":[""],"description":"Reveal is a Digital Global Good that uses spatial intelligence to drive delivery of life-saving interventions.","website":"https://revealprecision.com/","license":[{"spdx":"Apache-2.0","licenseURL":"https://github.com/akrosinc/reveal-server/blob/main/LICENSE"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":1,"evidenceText":"Reveal supports microplanning and mobilization of resources, including basic social services, financial aid, or food aid.

For Harmony, new integrations will tend to inform how visualizations, dashboards, and analyses need to function, and changes to those components might inform how the integration pipeline should change as well. Within Harmony, the full feature set of the product is immediately available to users once data is integrated. Therefore, users will not have to wait until different phases of the project to begin interacting with data once the data integration pipeline is created. Instead, users can immediately begin analyzing data, creating reports, building dashboards, validating results, providing feedback and making decisions. User feedback is collected and requirements are incorporated back into the Project Library (a comprehensive knowledge management resource), spurring a new round of development. Agile development at Zenysis ensures that users are involved at every stage of development and results in a product that is tightly aligned with evolving user needs.  Harmony was also developed in line with the Principles of Digital Development, including designing the software with the user in mind and building it for sustainability. The Harmony platform software was built with technical best practices at its core. Best practices include:  Cross-browser compatibility:  The platform supports Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox   Mobile web and responsive web design:  While the platform is optimized for desktop computers, the platform interface is responsive and features are reasonably available on mobile devices.   Internationalization:  The platform supports writing systems outside of the Latin alphabet (all UTF-8 characters, not just those designated LATIN). The project is built with a robust translation and localization library that enables users to translate any content.   Consistent style guidelines: Linters are used to maintain consistent style and naming conventions that adhere to the best practices for the respective language.

Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank’s classification.

Good Health and Well-being Evidence: Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various disease areas within the health sector, including but not limited to, for national and sub-national HIV, TB, and Malaria programs.

Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: “Zenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,” John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. “This model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda’s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis’ approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. “We attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,” said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. “We’ve had some partners pull out, saying: ‘Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.’” ","evidenceURL":"https://www.devex.com/news/zenysis-aims-to-be-government-operating-system-in-low-income-nations-100438"},{"SDGNumber":5,"evidenceText":"5. Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis’ software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis’ analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: “In public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.” Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA)","evidenceURL":"https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/8705/publication_privatesectorzenysis_focuson_en.pdf"},{"SDGNumber":6,"evidenceText":"6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a “virtual control room”, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an “mAlert system”, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique’s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.","evidenceURL":"https://www.ft.com/content/330b1734-684a-11ea-a6ac-9122541af204"},{"SDGNumber":8,"evidenceText":"8.

methodology. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a global standard security framework built on a role-based permissions management model that manages access at both the broad and granular levels by aligning the assigned permissions role with the organizational role of the user. RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication. PKI governs the issuance of digital certificates to protect sensitive data, provide unique digital identities for users, devices, and applications, and secure end-to-end communications. \n- Reveals’ infrastructure ís protected and encapsulated within a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Access to these components is governed via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), implementing the OpenVPN protocol.

UNBL contains several relevant layers associated with the SDG.  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for crops and flooded vegetation. Example: The Marine Priority Areas for Food Security layer identifies priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision and carbon storage.  Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03371-z  Example: the Crop Suitability Change layer shows general agricultural suitability considering rain-fed conditions and irrigation on currently irrigated areas.The dataset covers two time periods (2011-2040, 2071-2100), as well as changes in agricultural suitability over two periods (1981-2100, 2011-2100).

Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.

Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas.

Based on our visual identity and user experience discussions, we have used the CARTO base map public styles (not the proprietary style)as the base map for our map views. It provides a BSD 3-Clause License for the code and CC-BY 4.0 for the design. But it does have the following limitations: \n -- free usage for up to 75,000 map views per month \n-- none-commercial services only. \nThis service does not need to enable an API or an account to set up the base map. If the dark theme is not required, the developer can use alternatives quite easily by updating the code base use services such as Open Map Tiles. \n 3. DiCRA also includes a Satellite View which uses the Google Basemap which requires an account registration as well as setting up of API. But the codebase also includes an option to reconfigure it to use USGS or ESRI Base maps instead of Google service."},"documentation":{"isDocumentationAvailable":"Yes","documentationURL":["https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/tree/main/docs/manuals","https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/tree/main/src","https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/tree/main/docs/infrastructure"]},"NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","checkNonPIIAccessMechanism":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"The website allows the users to download in geospatial data formats any open data layer that is being visualized in the platform.

Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDK’s IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \n Ona’s Preference for Beam: \n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFi’s ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["We have measures to support GDPR compliance in place but none of the privacy laws listed affect our implementations yet.

The service was not developed with these directly in mind, but our process still fit well with many of these principles (which is reassuring both for the principles and Met Norway Weather):","I. Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX.

methodology. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a global standard security framework built on a role-based permissions management model that manages access at both the broad and granular levels by aligning the assigned permissions role with the organizational role of the user. RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication. PKI governs the issuance of digital certificates to protect sensitive data, provide unique digital identities for users, devices, and applications, and secure end-to-end communications. \n- Reveals’ infrastructure ís protected and encapsulated within a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Access to these components is governed via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), implementing the OpenVPN protocol. OpenVPN is an open-source VPN that is commonly used for creating Point-to-Point and Site-to-Site connections. It uses a traditional security protocol based on the  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. \n - Data transmission between Reveal Android client and Reveal Server is protected by the TLS encryption protocol. The Transport Layer Security  (TLS) generates an encrypted connection where the Android client acts as the client and user access is prohibited to specific applications instead of the entire network. \n - Data at rest on the Reveal Android client is encrypted using the AES256-SIV-CMAC encryption standard. \n Reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noQM0B5cGr2tq344zPrB-Yz-c5j0DyPDEGzIzhQ9VRA/edit"},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"Yes","typesOfDataCollected":["Firstname","Lastname","Age","Geographic Location"],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"Server security and encryption - The Reveal servers uphold all security standards for storage of PII including appropriate encryption processes and access restrictions."},"inappropriateIllegalContent":{"collectStoreDistribute":"No","type":"","contentFilter":"","policyGuidelinesDocumentationLink":"","illegalContentDetection":"","illegalContentDetectionMechanism":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"userInteraction":"No","addressSafetySecurityUnderageUsers":"","stepsAddressRiskPreventSafetyUnderageUsers":[""],"griefAbuseHarassmentProtection":"","harassmentProtectionSteps":[""]}},"locations":{"developmentCountries":{"ZMB":"Zambia","ZAF":"South Africa"},"deploymentCountries":{"ZMB":"Zambia","KEN":"Kenya","SEN":"Senegal","NGA":"Nigeria","MLI":"Mali"}},"aliases":[""],"description":"Reveal is a Digital Global Good that uses spatial intelligence to drive delivery of life-saving interventions.","website":"https://revealprecision.com/","license":[{"spdx":"Apache-2.0","licenseURL":"https://github.com/akrosinc/reveal-server/blob/main/LICENSE"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":1,"evidenceText":"Reveal supports microplanning and mobilization of resources, including basic social services, financial aid, or food aid.

For Harmony, new integrations will tend to inform how visualizations, dashboards, and analyses need to function, and changes to those components might inform how the integration pipeline should change as well. Within Harmony, the full feature set of the product is immediately available to users once data is integrated. Therefore, users will not have to wait until different phases of the project to begin interacting with data once the data integration pipeline is created. Instead, users can immediately begin analyzing data, creating reports, building dashboards, validating results, providing feedback and making decisions. User feedback is collected and requirements are incorporated back into the Project Library (a comprehensive knowledge management resource), spurring a new round of development. Agile development at Zenysis ensures that users are involved at every stage of development and results in a product that is tightly aligned with evolving user needs.  Harmony was also developed in line with the Principles of Digital Development, including designing the software with the user in mind and building it for sustainability. The Harmony platform software was built with technical best practices at its core. Best practices include:  Cross-browser compatibility:  The platform supports Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox   Mobile web and responsive web design:  While the platform is optimized for desktop computers, the platform interface is responsive and features are reasonably available on mobile devices.   Internationalization:  The platform supports writing systems outside of the Latin alphabet (all UTF-8 characters, not just those designated LATIN). The project is built with a robust translation and localization library that enables users to translate any content.   Consistent style guidelines: Linters are used to maintain consistent style and naming conventions that adhere to the best practices for the respective language.

It is also used by the RBM Partnership to End Malaria for global coordination of the malaria response. Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank’s classification.

Good Health and Well-being Evidence: Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various disease areas within the health sector, including but not limited to, for national and sub-national HIV, TB, and Malaria programs.

Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: “Zenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,” John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. “This model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda’s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis’ approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. “We attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,” said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. “We’ve had some partners pull out, saying: ‘Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.’” ","evidenceURL":"https://www.devex.com/news/zenysis-aims-to-be-government-operating-system-in-low-income-nations-100438"},{"SDGNumber":5,"evidenceText":"5. Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis’ software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis’ analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: “In public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.” Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA)","evidenceURL":"https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/8705/publication_privatesectorzenysis_focuson_en.pdf"},{"SDGNumber":6,"evidenceText":"6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a “virtual control room”, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an “mAlert system”, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique’s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.","evidenceURL":"https://www.ft.com/content/330b1734-684a-11ea-a6ac-9122541af204"},{"SDGNumber":8,"evidenceText":"8.

Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDK’s IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \n Ona’s Preference for Beam: \n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFi’s ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["We have measures to support GDPR compliance in place but none of the privacy laws listed affect our implementations yet.

Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX.

Our Terms of Use also indicate clearly that we don’t permit our clients to use non-CE-certified headsets. Also, our user instructions explicitly mention the maximum duration of allowable continuous operation on a VR headset with a single user/child which specifically addresses the overheating concern. Finally, we recommend to our clients a wide spectrum of alternatives, with regards to VR headsets, on which we test all our VR modules prior to product delivery. \n- Hardware-Software compatibility: We should always make sure that the developed software is compatible with the processor of the headset in terms of computational efficiency. Otherwise, the content would be poorly rendered with noticeable flickering, which impacts the user experience remarkably and biases the results. Since we develop the curriculum in house, we recommend to the clients the headsets on which the curriculum is tested by our team. Moreover, to mitigate this risk, we provide our product on a wide variety of headsets, with a wide range of costs, mainly to give the client the flexibility of choice according to their budget and accepted experience quality. \n\nOperational Risks \n- Potential dizziness effects on users: Our safety policy and user instructions strictly mentions that our system is not allowed to be used without a physically-existing supervisor. If the sessions are taking place on-premises so the specialist is the supervisor, and if the session is taking place at home, so the specialist is supervising remotely but a guardian is accompanying the child physically. This is mainly to remove the headset in case dizziness has been observed. Also, our user instructions explicitly mentions the maximum duration of allowable usage on a VR headset with a single user/child which addresses the dizziness concern. Finally, we only adopt VR headsets with explicit dizziness instructions for the users including Oculus, Pico, and Gear VR. \n- Potential habituation if not enough scenarios are developed and used: Our product plan takes into consideration the development of an ever-growing library of modules that takes into account the diversity of interests, social scenarios, acceptable difficulty levels, and the age range.

Currently we live in a technological age where children and adolescents live a normality that consists of the use of technological tools. They get bored easily, the way in which information is presented to them is not very motivating and school is no longer the only means of access to education. There are different tools through which they can acquire knowledge, however the minimum has a pedagogical basis. Due to the aforementioned, we must innovate in the teaching-learning process. Currently there are new teaching methodologies, with a focus on active learning and the development of skills through play. One of these methodologies is gamification. Different authors define it as a process in which game mechanisms are used to attract people, promote learning and solve problems. The purpose is to motivate the player's behavior. Elements in the game such as points, avatars or levels, increase the psychological predisposition of the player to continue in it. This makes gamification an ally of education. Currently there are game developers who use platforms like Godot, however they do not have the pedagogical knowledge to add elements that help the user to consolidate their learning. That's why Pixframe Studios is developing a plugin for the Godot Engine: a tool to help new game developers and serious game teams create new games with the goal of aiding in the development of education. As mentioned before, Latin America is still trying to develop new tools to improve their educational field, nevertheless they don't have enough knowledge nor tools to achieve it. The plugin is open source so that the community in Latin America can access new ways of creating video games with a pedagogical basis. In this way, code is created, optimized and shared.

Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees. Risk: Sustainability of the content and adaptability to updated curricula. Mitigation: As demonstrated in the video above, the Notesmaster platform has developed an online peer review system that allows all stakeholders to contribute to a sustainable multiplier effect, leading to growing number of digital resources. These digital lessons can be copied and reversioned, then submitted for peer review by the local community. \n Risk: Impersonation of Teachers by students.

For Harmony, new integrations will tend to inform how visualizations, dashboards, and analyses need to function, and changes to those components might inform how the integration pipeline should change as well. Within Harmony, the full feature set of the product is immediately available to users once data is integrated. Therefore, users will not have to wait until different phases of the project to begin interacting with data once the data integration pipeline is created. Instead, users can immediately begin analyzing data, creating reports, building dashboards, validating results, providing feedback and making decisions. User feedback is collected and requirements are incorporated back into the Project Library (a comprehensive knowledge management resource), spurring a new round of development. Agile development at Zenysis ensures that users are involved at every stage of development and results in a product that is tightly aligned with evolving user needs.  Harmony was also developed in line with the Principles of Digital Development, including designing the software with the user in mind and building it for sustainability. The Harmony platform software was built with technical best practices at its core. Best practices include:  Cross-browser compatibility:  The platform supports Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox   Mobile web and responsive web design:  While the platform is optimized for desktop computers, the platform interface is responsive and features are reasonably available on mobile devices.   Internationalization:  The platform supports writing systems outside of the Latin alphabet (all UTF-8 characters, not just those designated LATIN). The project is built with a robust translation and localization library that enables users to translate any content.

Excerpt from Devex Article: “Zenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,” John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. “This model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda’s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis’ approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. “We attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,” said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. “We’ve had some partners pull out, saying: ‘Our time here has elapsed.

In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0).

Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees.

RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication.

Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas.

For Harmony, new integrations will tend to inform how visualizations, dashboards, and analyses need to function, and changes to those components might inform how the integration pipeline should change as well. Within Harmony, the full feature set of the product is immediately available to users once data is integrated. Therefore, users will not have to wait until different phases of the project to begin interacting with data once the data integration pipeline is created. Instead, users can immediately begin analyzing data, creating reports, building dashboards, validating results, providing feedback and making decisions. User feedback is collected and requirements are incorporated back into the Project Library (a comprehensive knowledge management resource), spurring a new round of development. Agile development at Zenysis ensures that users are involved at every stage of development and results in a product that is tightly aligned with evolving user needs.  Harmony was also developed in line with the Principles of Digital Development, including designing the software with the user in mind and building it for sustainability. The Harmony platform software was built with technical best practices at its core. Best practices include:  Cross-browser compatibility:  The platform supports Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox   Mobile web and responsive web design:  While the platform is optimized for desktop computers, the platform interface is responsive and features are reasonably available on mobile devices.   Internationalization:  The platform supports writing systems outside of the Latin alphabet (all UTF-8 characters, not just those designated LATIN).

Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: “Zenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,” John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. “This model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda’s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis’ approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. “We attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,” said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. “We’ve had some partners pull out, saying: ‘Our time here has elapsed.

Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis’ software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis’ analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: “In public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times.

Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a “virtual control room”, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an “mAlert system”, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique’s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.","evidenceURL":"https://www.ft.com/content/330b1734-684a-11ea-a6ac-9122541af204"},{"SDGNumber":8,"evidenceText":"8.

For Harmony, new integrations will tend to inform how visualizations, dashboards, and analyses need to function, and changes to those components might inform how the integration pipeline should change as well. Within Harmony, the full feature set of the product is immediately available to users once data is integrated. Therefore, users will not have to wait until different phases of the project to begin interacting with data once the data integration pipeline is created. Instead, users can immediately begin analyzing data, creating reports, building dashboards, validating results, providing feedback and making decisions. User feedback is collected and requirements are incorporated back into the Project Library (a comprehensive knowledge management resource), spurring a new round of development. Agile development at Zenysis ensures that users are involved at every stage of development and results in a product that is tightly aligned with evolving user needs.  Harmony was also developed in line with the Principles of Digital Development, including designing the software with the user in mind and building it for sustainability. The Harmony platform software was built with technical best practices at its core. Best practices include:  Cross-browser compatibility:  The platform supports Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox   Mobile web and responsive web design:  While the platform is optimized for desktop computers, the platform interface is responsive and features are reasonably available on mobile devices.   Internationalization:  The platform supports writing systems outside of the Latin alphabet (all UTF-8 characters, not just those designated LATIN). The project is built with a robust translation and localization library that enables users to translate any content.   Consistent style guidelines: Linters are used to maintain consistent style and naming conventions that adhere to the best practices for the respective language.

Excerpt from Devex Article: “Zenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,” John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. “This model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda’s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis’ approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. “We attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,” said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. “We’ve had some partners pull out, saying: ‘Our time here has elapsed.

In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0).

Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX.

Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees. Risk: Sustainability of the content and adaptability to updated curricula. Mitigation: As demonstrated in the video above, the Notesmaster platform has developed an online peer review system that allows all stakeholders to contribute to a sustainable multiplier effect, leading to growing number of digital resources. These digital lessons can be copied and reversioned, then submitted for peer review by the local community. \n Risk: Impersonation of Teachers by students. Mitigation: The platform is designed in such away that persons impersonating teachers can do little harm. They are not able to achieve a position of influence over their peers through impersonation. The respective Ministries of Education have a roster of curriculum officers who regularly access the platform and respond to challenges or flag unruly language or behaviour.

According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in people with disabilities engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability. Digital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure 'no one is left behind' in our increasingly digital world. Purple HATS offers a solution that significantly contributes to the improvement of digital accessibility. The customisable, automated accessibility testing tool allows software development teams to find and fix accessibility problems to improve persons with disabilities' access to digital services."}],"sectors":[],"type":["software"],"repositories":[{"name":"Purple-hats","url":"https://github.com/GovTechSG/purple-hats"}],"organizations":[{"name":"Government Technology Agency, Singapore","website":"https://www.tech.gov.sg","org_type":"owner","contact_name":"Zui Young Lim","contact_email":"accessibility@tech.gov.sg"}],"stage":"DPG","search":"dpg"},{"name":"Human Essentials","clearOwnership":{"isOwnershipExplicit":"Yes","copyrightURL":"https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials/blob/main/README.md"},"platformIndependence":{"mandatoryDepsCreateMoreRestrictions":"No","isSoftwarePltIndependent":"","pltIndependenceDesc":""},"documentation":{"isDocumentationAvailable":"Yes","documentationURL":["https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials/blob/main/README.md"]},"NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","checkNonPIIAccessMechanism":"","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["Privacy policy - https://humanessentials.app/privacypolicy"],"adherenceSteps":["Privacy policy - https://humanessentials.app/privacypolicy"]},"standards":{"supportStandards":"Yes","standardsList":["HTTPS, SSL, SSH, OAuth 2, JWT, UTF-8, HTML, CSS, ES7, REST, JSON, CSV, PDF, PNG"],"evidenceStandardSupport":["https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials"],"implementBestPractices":"Yes","bestPracticesList":["Agile Development","12 Factor","TDD","CI/CD","Code Reviews","DRY"]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"The team actively maintains the project and works directly with the organizations using the software.

Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDK’s IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \n Ona’s Preference for Beam: \n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFi’s ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"privacy":{"isPrivacyCompliant":"Yes","privacyComplianceList":["We have measures to support GDPR compliance in place but none of the privacy laws listed affect our implementations yet.

Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees. Risk: Sustainability of the content and adaptability to updated curricula. Mitigation: As demonstrated in the video above, the Notesmaster platform has developed an online peer review system that allows all stakeholders to contribute to a sustainable multiplier effect, leading to growing number of digital resources. These digital lessons can be copied and reversioned, then submitted for peer review by the local community. \n Risk: Impersonation of Teachers by students. Mitigation: The platform is designed in such away that persons impersonating teachers can do little harm. They are not able to achieve a position of influence over their peers through impersonation.

Finally, we recommend to our clients a wide spectrum of alternatives, with regards to VR headsets, on which we test all our VR modules prior to product delivery. \n- Hardware-Software compatibility: We should always make sure that the developed software is compatible with the processor of the headset in terms of computational efficiency. Otherwise, the content would be poorly rendered with noticeable flickering, which impacts the user experience remarkably and biases the results. Since we develop the curriculum in house, we recommend to the clients the headsets on which the curriculum is tested by our team.

Example: The Nature Map Realised Clean Water Provision layer consists of a globally normalized map (from 0 to 1) of pixels ranked for their relative importance in delivering clean water to downstream beneficiaries. Example: The City Water Map layer contains information on the water sources for 534 cities internationally. The watershed layer shown here includes information about the catchment area of the watershed that supplies these cities.  Example layer in link below.","evidenceURL":"https://map.unbiodiversitylab.org/earth?basemap=grayscale&coordinates=20,0,2&layers=naturemap-realised-clean-water-provision_100"},{"SDGNumber":11,"evidenceText":"Mapping urban areas, and trends in urban development is relevant here. At 10m scale users can also start to identify large green spaces in urban areas and agricultural peripheries. UNBL provides a number of layers related to this.  Example: The Global Grid of Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030 layer presents spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land cover change from 2000 to 2030 at a 2.5 arc-minute resolution. Citation: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211658109  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for Built Areas.

Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to nature-based solutions for climate change.  Example layer included in link below.","evidenceURL":"https://map.unbiodiversitylab.org/earth?basemap=grayscale&coordinates=20,0,2&layers=biomass-carbon-density-2010_100"},{"SDGNumber":15,"evidenceText":"UNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas. UNBL draws protected area data directly from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Protected Areas offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to Protected Areas.

Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas.

The service was not developed with these directly in mind, but our process still fit well with many of these principles (which is reassuring both for the principles and Met Norway Weather):","I. Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX. Be collaborative. \n - Building the service is continuously done through a close collaboration between IT personnel and geoscience researchers (meteorological and computational co-design). \n - The interface to the service was created in close collaboration with important users of our service."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"We keep traffic logs with ip-addresses, and these logs can probably be considered as some kind of personal data.

Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas.

Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX.

Typically this is with foundational ID systems (e.g. National ID) and health systems (e.g. DHIS2). This feature of interoperability is very important as the universal data set of birth and deaths can help ensure government services are inclusive.\nNational ID: OpenCRVS can integrate with any National ID system in order to reliably validate the existence of NID numbers provided during civil registration applications as well as reduce the time spent on the application form itself by pulling data from the NID system and auto-populate form fields.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can be integrated with a National ID system in a number of ways, depending on system capabilities. Current use cases include:\n- To validate the existence of a NID number\n- To auto-populate the form with data from the NID field to minimise required effort from registration staff\n- To create a National ID for a new registration when the event occurs.\nHealth: Births and deaths often occur in health facilities and those that occur in the community can be dealt with by health staff at the community level. These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an 'in-progress' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems.

For Harmony, new integrations will tend to inform how visualizations, dashboards, and analyses need to function, and changes to those components might inform how the integration pipeline should change as well. Within Harmony, the full feature set of the product is immediately available to users once data is integrated. Therefore, users will not have to wait until different phases of the project to begin interacting with data once the data integration pipeline is created. Instead, users can immediately begin analyzing data, creating reports, building dashboards, validating results, providing feedback and making decisions. User feedback is collected and requirements are incorporated back into the Project Library (a comprehensive knowledge management resource), spurring a new round of development. Agile development at Zenysis ensures that users are involved at every stage of development and results in a product that is tightly aligned with evolving user needs.  Harmony was also developed in line with the Principles of Digital Development, including designing the software with the user in mind and building it for sustainability. The Harmony platform software was built with technical best practices at its core. Best practices include:  Cross-browser compatibility:  The platform supports Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Firefox   Mobile web and responsive web design:  While the platform is optimized for desktop computers, the platform interface is responsive and features are reasonably available on mobile devices.   Internationalization:  The platform supports writing systems outside of the Latin alphabet (all UTF-8 characters, not just those designated LATIN). The project is built with a robust translation and localization library that enables users to translate any content.   Consistent style guidelines: Linters are used to maintain consistent style and naming conventions that adhere to the best practices for the respective language.

Excerpt from Devex Article: “Zenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,” John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. “This model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda’s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis’ approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. “We attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,” said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. “We’ve had some partners pull out, saying: ‘Our time here has elapsed.

By using Zenysis’ analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: “In public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.” Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA)","evidenceURL":"https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/8705/publication_privatesectorzenysis_focuson_en.pdf"},{"SDGNumber":6,"evidenceText":"6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a “virtual control room”, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an “mAlert system”, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing.

Typically this is with foundational ID systems (e.g. National ID) and health systems (e.g. DHIS2). This feature of interoperability is very important as the universal data set of birth and deaths can help ensure government services are inclusive.\nNational ID: OpenCRVS can integrate with any National ID system in order to reliably validate the existence of NID numbers provided during civil registration applications as well as reduce the time spent on the application form itself by pulling data from the NID system and auto-populate form fields.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can be integrated with a National ID system in a number of ways, depending on system capabilities. Current use cases include:\n- To validate the existence of a NID number\n- To auto-populate the form with data from the NID field to minimise required effort from registration staff\n- To create a National ID for a new registration when the event occurs.\nHealth: Births and deaths often occur in health facilities and those that occur in the community can be dealt with by health staff at the community level. These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an 'in-progress' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems.

See https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/keyFeatures which shows features that facilitate inclusion and aim to mitigate the risk that individuals are disadvantaged because they are not registered in the civil registry."},"inappropriateIllegalContent":{"collectStoreDistribute":"No","type":"","contentFilter":"","policyGuidelinesDocumentationLink":"","illegalContentDetection":"","illegalContentDetectionMechanism":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"userInteraction":"No","addressSafetySecurityUnderageUsers":"","stepsAddressRiskPreventSafetyUnderageUsers":[""],"griefAbuseHarassmentProtection":"","harassmentProtectionSteps":[""]}},"locations":{"developmentCountries":{"GBR":"United Kingdom","ZAF":"South Africa","BGD":"Bangladesh"},"deploymentCountries":{"BGD":"Bangladesh"}},"aliases":["Open Civil Registration and Vital Statistics"],"description":"OpenCRVS is an open-source software for civil registration, designed for low resource settings","website":"https://www.opencrvs.org/","license":[{"spdx":"MPL-2.0","licenseURL":"https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/blob/master/LICENSE"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":16,"evidenceText":"OpenCRVS is a digital public good to help achieve universal civil registration and evidence-based decision making in all country contexts.\nOpenCRVS was created in direct response to: \nSDG Goal/Target 16.9: \"By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration\"\nIndicator: Proportion of children under 5 years whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age\n addition (as of March 2017), 67 of the 230 SDG indicators can be measured effectively by using data derived from well-functioning CRVS systems, in particular for the numerators (births, deaths) and denominators (total population, live births, total deaths).

The service was not developed with these directly in mind, but our process still fit well with many of these principles (which is reassuring both for the principles and Met Norway Weather):","I. Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX. Be collaborative. \n - Building the service is continuously done through a close collaboration between IT personnel and geoscience researchers (meteorological and computational co-design). \n - The interface to the service was created in close collaboration with important users of our service."]},"doNoHarm":{"preventHarm":{"stepsToPreventHarm":"Yes","additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies":"We keep traffic logs with ip-addresses, and these logs can probably be considered as some kind of personal data.

Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees. Risk: Sustainability of the content and adaptability to updated curricula. Mitigation: As demonstrated in the video above, the Notesmaster platform has developed an online peer review system that allows all stakeholders to contribute to a sustainable multiplier effect, leading to growing number of digital resources. These digital lessons can be copied and reversioned, then submitted for peer review by the local community. \n Risk: Impersonation of Teachers by students. Mitigation: The platform is designed in such away that persons impersonating teachers can do little harm. They are not able to achieve a position of influence over their peers through impersonation. The respective Ministries of Education have a roster of curriculum officers who regularly access the platform and respond to challenges or flag unruly language or behaviour. They are supported by the Notesmaster support team whose task is to ensure the smooth running of the platform."},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"Yes","typesOfDataCollected":["First Name","Surname","Email address","School or Institution of Learning","Country of teaching or learning"],"thirdPartyDataSharing":"No","dataSharingCircumstances":[""],"ensurePrivacySecurity":"Yes","privacySecurityDescription":"Security of your personal information: We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. \nYou acknowledge that the transmission of information over the Internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.\n You are responsible for keeping your password and other login details confidential.
