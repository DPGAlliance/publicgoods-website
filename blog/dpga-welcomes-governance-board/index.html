<p>At its formation, the Digital Public Goods Alliance was governed by an interim strategy group (ISG) made up of co-founding members. They included iSPIRT; the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad); Sierra Leone’s Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI); and UNICEF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021, the decision was made to evolve the ISG to a governing board, and expand its membership. The board functions as a strategic decision-making and oversight body for the DPGA Secretariat, and consists of member-organisations who demonstrate a strong commitment to digital public goods and are committed to supporting the DPGA’s mission and mandate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beginning 1 January, 2022, the governing board of the DPGA includes: German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); iSPIRT; the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad); Sierra Leone’s Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI); UNDP; and UNICEF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The culmination of expertise and diversity of experience across the organisations and individuals on the board will be beneficial in the next phase of growth for the Digital Public Goods Alliance. Please join us in welcoming the new governing board.</p>
