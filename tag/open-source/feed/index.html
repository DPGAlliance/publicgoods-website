<p>The Digital Public Goods Alliance has spent the last several months <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/setting-a-standard-for-digital-public-goods/">developing</a> the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">Digital Public Goods Standard</a>, and working with stakeholders from across sectors to determine criteria that allows us to answer the question: <strong>is this a digital public good?</strong></p>



<p>In alignment with the UN Secretary-General’s 2020 <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>, we define digital public goods (DPGs) as open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm and are of high relevance for attaining the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>



<p>Many types of digital technologies and content – from data to apps, data visualisation tools to educational curricula – could accelerate achievement of the SDGs. However, it is only if they are freely and openly available, with minimal restrictions on how they can be distributed, adapted and reused that we can think of them as “digital public goods”. </p>



<h4><strong>Why Open Source? </strong></h4>



<p>Not all open source projects are digital public goods, but all digital public goods must be open source. </p>



<p>Open source is broadly defined as when the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. This is a crucial part of digital public goods where, for example, software, content and data must be accessible independently of any particular vendor and allow software, data and content to be freely used, modified, and shared. There are many existing open licenses, and the choice of license has implications on how the code, data or content can be reused. <strong>We’ll therefore dig deeper into the process of identifying which “approved” licenses were included in the DPG Standard, and why, in our next blog post.</strong> In this post we present an overview of the case for open source. </p>



<p>“Open” ensures the software, data, AI model, standard or content we’re working with can be <em>adopted, scaled and adapted</em> in various country contexts. It also ensures <em>transparency</em>, can contribute to project <em>sustainability</em>, and reduces the risk of <em>vendor lock-in</em>. Below we describe each of these benefits in turn. </p>



<h4><strong>Adoptability, Scalability &amp; Adaptability </strong></h4>



<p>For digital public goods to scale across markets, they must be freely adoptable and adaptable. </p>



<p>For example, the Modular Open Source Identity Platform (<a href="https://www.mosip.io/">MOSIP</a>), a technology that helps governments implement a foundational ID, can be freely adopted by countries who can adapt the open software to fit their local needs. This can help build long-term ownership and agency within each implementing country and can also allow the platform to scale over time across many countries. </p>



<h4><strong>Transparency &amp; Sustainability </strong></h4>



<p>Open source licensing allows a digital public goods’ code base to be independently scrutinized and audited. This can increase accountability and facilitate discourse about the steps that have been taken to design technologies that are inclusive and do no harm. </p>



<p>Having a transparent code base can also allow for greater sustainability. As each implementing country adapts or iterates on the code, these changes can be shared back to help evolve and better the source code. </p>



<h4><strong>Vendor Lock-In </strong></h4>



<p>It can be costly to obtain licenses from vendors. This can also cause ‘lock-in’, meaning that a government or organization is beholden to that vendor for relevant service or maintenance for the duration of the contract. Additionally, state-owned solutions could suffer from politicization of access, where states may choose to give permission to their allies over others, making access vulnerable to geopolitical shifts and tensions. </p>



<p>While the cost of implementing and configuring open source software is often comparable to purchasing a license, open source offers more control and independence and reduces the risk of vendor or political lock-in. This makes it easier for governments in particular to plan their digital futures in a holistic and long-term way.</p>



<p>Finally, an open approach to digital development can help to increase collaboration and resource mobilization in the digital development community, avoid duplicating work that has already been done, and attract new investors and contributors to initiatives with high-impact potential. This allows programs to maximize their resources — and ultimately their impact — through open standards, open data, open source technologies and open innovation.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Open source is a necessary condition for any technology to be considered a digital public good. </strong>It enables sharing, reuse and adaptation to suit local needs. And, combined with the right support and funding structures, open source represents an unprecedented opportunity to fundamentally alter power balances in international development. This means more creation and iteration can happen locally; trust in technology can be built through agency and transparency; and, best practices and learnings can be shared across geographical, institutional and expertise borders. We believe this is critical to advancing a more equitable world and is why open source is fundamental to the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA).</p>

<p>Yesterday, DPGA Co-Founder UNICEF published <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/unicefs-open-source-approach-innovation">this article</a> outlining UNICEF&#8217;s various tools and platforms that operationalise its commitment to open source. </p>



<p>Please find an excerpt below. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>UNICEF has a 70-year history of innovating for children and believes that new approaches, partnerships and technologies that support the realization of children’s rights are critical to improving their lives.</p>



<p>As recognised in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">UN Secretary-General&#8217;s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation Report</a> in June 2020,&nbsp; digital public goods &#8211; defined as “open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content” have a critical role in accelerating achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>



<p>UNICEF along with the Governments of Norway and Sierra Leone, and the India-based think tank iSPIRT have jointly established the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>, a multi-stakeholder initiative to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods. The DPGA is an effort to convene a network of partners from different sectors that will contribute to the identification, support, scale-up, and use of software, data, and algorithms that can advance humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As partners explore and scale efforts on digital public goods, UNICEF is sharing its experience in setting up operational processes and tools to support and build open source across all of it’s work.</p>

<p><strong>NEW: Follow the Digital Public Goods Alliance on Twitter</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/DPGAlliance"> @DPGAlliance</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Last week we kicked off a four part series. </strong>In each part, we will share exciting work from one of the Co-Founders of the Digital Public Goods Alliance. This week we’re featuring Norway.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-1-meet-our-co-founders-ispirt-61f1f41d6642" target="_blank">If you missed Part 1 on iSPIRT last week, you can see it here.</a></p>



<p>As we said last week, one of the fundamental strengths of the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) is its decentralized, yet coordinated structure. Each member of the current Interim Strategy Group (ISG) &#8211; consisting of iSPIRT, Norway, Sierra Leone and UNICEF &#8211; brings their own areas of expertise and interest to the DPGA which makes it stronger and more diverse in its reach and potential impact. As the DPGA is built out over time, membership will expand and change to include more stakeholders.&nbsp;In this four part series, we’re pleased to offer a snapshot of the exciting work being led by each of the current ISG members. <strong>This week we focus on Norway.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Norway</strong></h4>



<p>Norway believes in the deployment of digital public goods as a means to help countries accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and is a proud champion and co-founder of the DPGA together with the government of Sierra Leone, UNICEF and iSPIRT.</p>



<p>Their work funds high-impact digital public goods in several sectors including health, early grade reading, climate and weather services, and plant pest management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Norway has worked on expanding existing digital public goods in both the health and education sectors. One example is <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/about">DHIS2</a>, an open source, web-based software platform for data collection, management, and analysis, used by governments and NGOs in more than 100 countries. Starting with a pilot in Sri Lanka, more than 30 countries have deployed standardized <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/covid-19">DHIS2 COVID-19 surveillance digital data packages</a> since the pandemic began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Norway has also seen a rapid scale up in the use of the <a href="https://digitallibrary.io/">Global Digital Library platform</a> for openly licensed early grade reading resources, and together with ADEA and UNESCO are also supporting a number of countries in translating early grade reading books into local languages, and fast-tracking the availability of <a href="https://freelearning.io/">learning resources</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13115228/Screenshot_2020-10-08-Meld-St-11-2019%E2%80%932020-Report-to-the-Storting-white-paper-Summary.png" alt="" class="wp-image-580"/><figcaption>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meldst11_summary/id2699502/?ch=1</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the DPGA develops, Norway would like to engage other bilateral and philanthropic donors in conversations on how each can best contribute to supporting the global architecture around digital public goods.   </p>



<p>You can find out more about Norway’s commitment to digital public goods by reading their white paper for <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meldst11_summary/id2699502/?utm_source=www.regjeringen.no&amp;utm_medium=epost&amp;utm_campaign=nyhetsvarsel%2024.04.2020&amp;utm_content=Utviklingssamarbeid">Digital Transformation and Development Policy</a> or watching <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/144183dc9f125c64ba38531766cfda063f0">this address</a> from Prime Minister Solberg. </p>



<p>Norway is co-hosting the DPGA and will engage at the forefront of the Climate Adaptation Community of Practice. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Since its launch, the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a> &#8212; an initiative co-founded by iSPIRT, Sierra Leone, The Government of Norway and UNICEF &#8212; has been working to identify, support and promote digital public goods to implement recommendation 1B from the <a href="https://digitalcooperation.org/">June 2019 Report of the UN Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation</a>.  </p>



<h2>Get Involved</h2>



<p>Only by working together can we make this happen. The Digital Public Goods Alliance is, itself an open project, and we seek engagement and support from any governments, businesses, civil society, technology providers, donors, and experts wishing to help us achieve our aim.</p>
