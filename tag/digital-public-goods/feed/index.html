<p><strong>This is the third in a four-part series featuring exciting work from the Co-Founders of the Digital Public Goods Alliance. </strong>This week we’re featuring Sierra Leone.</p>



<p> If you missed it, check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-1-meet-our-co-founders-ispirt-61f1f41d6642" target="_blank">Part 1 on iSPIRT</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-2-meet-our-co-founder-norway-1020112d1ad6" target="_blank">Part 2 on Norway</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sierra Leone&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>&nbsp;Sierra Leone’s Directorate of Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (DSTI) has highlighted how youth empowerment, economic reform and health infrastructure can open up regional possibilities. Like iSPIRT, Sierra Leone is leading by example, creating a virtuous cycle driven by their four pillars (Data for Decision Making, Service Delivery &amp; Citizen Engagement, Data Systems &amp; Technology Design, and Ecosystem Strengthening) that serve as a foundation to turn Sierra Leone into an innovation and entrepreneurship hub, that other developing countries can emulate.&nbsp;<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>The DSTI in particular is playing a key role by engaging private sector and university communities to help build the technology that makes the implementation of digital public goods possible. This comes from an understanding that, in order for DPGs to evolve at scale and with a lower barrier to entry, there needs to be a supportive ecosystem built up that addresses questions of resourcing and intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sierra Leone is also <a href="https://www.dsti.gov.sl/sierra-leone-national-innovation-digital-strategy-2019-2029">setting an example</a> by documenting their progress and lessons learned. DSTI gathers data to support policy and decision-making in the public interest and makes relevant data gathered throughout the process publicly available.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NEW: Follow the Digital Public Goods Alliance on Twitter</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/DPGAlliance"> @DPGAlliance</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Last week we kicked off a four part series. </strong>In each part, we will share exciting work from one of the Co-Founders of the Digital Public Goods Alliance. This week we’re featuring Norway.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-1-meet-our-co-founders-ispirt-61f1f41d6642" target="_blank">If you missed Part 1 on iSPIRT last week, you can see it here.</a></p>



<p>As we said last week, one of the fundamental strengths of the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) is its decentralized, yet coordinated structure. Each member of the current Interim Strategy Group (ISG) &#8211; consisting of iSPIRT, Norway, Sierra Leone and UNICEF &#8211; brings their own areas of expertise and interest to the DPGA which makes it stronger and more diverse in its reach and potential impact. As the DPGA is built out over time, membership will expand and change to include more stakeholders.&nbsp;In this four part series, we’re pleased to offer a snapshot of the exciting work being led by each of the current ISG members. <strong>This week we focus on Norway.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4><strong>Norway</strong></h4>



<p>Norway believes in the deployment of digital public goods as a means to help countries accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and is a proud champion and co-founder of the DPGA together with the government of Sierra Leone, UNICEF and iSPIRT.</p>



<p>Their work funds high-impact digital public goods in several sectors including health, early grade reading, climate and weather services, and plant pest management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Norway has worked on expanding existing digital public goods in both the health and education sectors. One example is <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/about">DHIS2</a>, an open source, web-based software platform for data collection, management, and analysis, used by governments and NGOs in more than 100 countries. Starting with a pilot in Sri Lanka, more than 30 countries have deployed standardized <a href="https://www.dhis2.org/covid-19">DHIS2 COVID-19 surveillance digital data packages</a> since the pandemic began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Norway has also seen a rapid scale up in the use of the <a href="https://digitallibrary.io/">Global Digital Library platform</a> for openly licensed early grade reading resources, and together with ADEA and UNESCO are also supporting a number of countries in translating early grade reading books into local languages, and fast-tracking the availability of <a href="https://freelearning.io/">learning resources</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13115228/Screenshot_2020-10-08-Meld-St-11-2019%E2%80%932020-Report-to-the-Storting-white-paper-Summary.png" alt="" class="wp-image-580"/><figcaption>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meldst11_summary/id2699502/?ch=1</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the DPGA develops, Norway would like to engage other bilateral and philanthropic donors in conversations on how each can best contribute to supporting the global architecture around digital public goods.   </p>



<p>You can find out more about Norway’s commitment to digital public goods by reading their white paper for <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meldst11_summary/id2699502/?utm_source=www.regjeringen.no&amp;utm_medium=epost&amp;utm_campaign=nyhetsvarsel%2024.04.2020&amp;utm_content=Utviklingssamarbeid">Digital Transformation and Development Policy</a> or watching <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/144183dc9f125c64ba38531766cfda063f0">this address</a> from Prime Minister Solberg. </p>



<p>Norway is co-hosting the DPGA and will engage at the forefront of the Climate Adaptation Community of Practice. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>NEW: Follow the Digital Public Goods Alliance on Twitter</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/DPGAlliance"> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/DPGAlliance">@DPGAlliance</a></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/4ae88231c358/digital-public-goods-mailing-list">In our newsletter</a> last week, we kicked off <strong> a four part series to introduce the work of the Digital Public Goods Alliance Co-Founders. </strong>In each part, we will share exciting work from one of the Co-Founders and in this, our first week we’re featuring iSPIRT.</p>



<p>During the digital public goods roundtable event in mid-September Fabrizio Hochschild Drummond, Special Adviser on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the United Nations’ 75th Anniversary, shared that, “The digital world is a decentralized world and that is one of its virtues.” However, there must be some sense of coordination and access to this decentralized system and a unifying platform for digital public goods is a high priority.</p>



<p>One of the fundamental strengths of the Digital Public Goods (DPG) Alliance is its decentralized, yet coordinated structure. Each member of the current Interim Strategy Group (ISG) &#8211; consisting of iSPIRT, Norway, Sierra Leone and UNICEF &#8211; brings their own areas of expertise and interest to the DPG Alliance which makes it stronger and more diverse in its reach and potential impact. </p>



<p>As the DPG Alliance is built out over time, membership will expand and change to include more stakeholders.&nbsp;In this four part series, we’re pleased to offer a snapshot of the exciting work being led by each of the current ISG members. <strong>This week we focus on iSPIRT.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h4>iSPIRT</h4>



<p><a href="https://ispirt.in">iSPIRT</a> (Indian Software Products Industry Round Table) is a non-profit think tank that builds public goods for Indian product startups to thrive and grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India is fast tracking digital development. In the last 10 years alone, over 400 million bank accounts were opened in India while at the same time it built up and delivered one of the most advanced payment systems in the world. All of this is thanks to accessible digital public goods.</p>



<p>Now, the Indian government is working on data empowerment and protection architecture to enable citizens to share their data to get a loan, apply for a visa etc. all in a seamless way via an open credit system. You can <a href="https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2020-09/DEPA-Book_0.pdf">read more about it in this paper</a>, prepared by iSPIRT. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpg-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06120857/Screenshot_2020-10-02-DEPA-Book_0-pdf.png" alt="" class="wp-image-565"/><figcaption>Reference: https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2020-09/DEPA-Book_0.pdf </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Extensive work has also begun in the healthcare sector with the creation of a public health registry that gives people the right to move their health data from one provider to another. As this process becomes standardized, turnaround times in the health care sector will be greatly reduced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a part of the Digital Public Goods Alliance, iSPIRT is leading by example in the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">Financial Inclusion Community of Practice</a> and can share learnings and best practices from their work with other governments. </p>
