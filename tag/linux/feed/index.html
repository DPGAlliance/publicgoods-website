<p><em>The DPGA is beta launching <a href="https://resources.digitalpublicgoods.net/">DPG Resources</a>, an emerging collection of resources to support projects to become digital public goods.</em></p>



<p>Aiding the discovery and development of digital public goods is at the core of everything we do. Which is why we are excited to announce that this week we launched a beta version of <a href="https://resources.digitalpublicgoods.net/">DPG Resources</a>, a collection of resources that will support projects on their journey to becoming a digital public good. This is a beta version of the project, so we are actively seeking additional resources to include. If you are aware of any additional resources, please share them via <a href="https://dpgresources.com/nominate-a-dpg-resource/">this form</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to become a digital public good, a project must meet the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">DPG Standard</a>. The DPG Standard is a set of 9 indicators that were developed by the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) to operationalise the definition of digital public goods set by the UN Secretary-General in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">2020 Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a><em>. </em> Indicators range from open source licensing to relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals. You can read more about the creation of the DPG Standard <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/setting-a-standard-for-digital-public-goods/">here</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://resources.digitalpublicgoods.net/">DPG Resources</a> aims to become a curated collection of publicly available tools that can help projects meet and surpass the minimum standard.    Meeting this minimum standard will increase the discoverability of a project and consequently its ability to make sustainable impact through reuse and adaptation. Going beyond the minimum standard enables projects to embrace the full potential of open source. For this reason, the DPG Resources collection includes resources to help projects go even deeper on areas such as documentation, community development, and child online protection. </p>

<p>DPG Resources draws on efforts by other prominent open-source stakeholders including GitHub, Linux Foundation, Open Source Initiative (OSI), and many more. By bringing together resources from across the open source community, we seek to highlight the important work that has already been documented, and to provide relevant resources that can help a project maximise their impact. </p>



<p>Throughout the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGzlBiecPBlVvJXmcMKXF3zdxASY8vGnrdnNNwp7fVKb169A/viewform">nomination process</a>, projects are asked to demonstrate their compliance to the indicators in the DPG Standard. Therefore, the navigation of the DPG Resources site includes categorisation based on these indicators and will be built upon over time. DPG Resources also includes an <a href="https://resources.digitalpublicgoods.net/category/faq/">FAQ section</a> that helps individuals navigate the nomination process.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Feedback on the beta version&nbsp;</h4>



<p>We want to make sure we are providing the tools and resources that are the most useful to projects during the nomination phase. In the spirit of open source, the DPG Resources platform is launching in beta, and asking you to help provide feedback through observation, conversation, and co-creation. Receiving feedback from users as we build, test, and adjust our beta version will help make sure we are supporting projects with the most relevant resources. All feedback or questions regarding this platform are warmly welcomed and much appreciated. Your thoughts on how we can improve can easily be provided through <a href="https://dpgresources.com/beta-testing-feedback/">this form</a>.</p>



<h4>This is just the beginning</h4>



<p>The resources currently available on the DPG Resources site are just the beginning. We want to be constantly evolving by providing new content and links as frequently as possible. If you know of resources that could be relevant to projects working to become digital public goods, you can suggest them by using this <a href="https://dpgresources.com/nominate-a-dpg-resource/">submission form</a>.</p>
