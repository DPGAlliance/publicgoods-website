				<description><![CDATA[Paper launched on understanding the relationship between digital public goods and global goods in the context of digital health. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>In 2020 the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) convened a Health Community of Practice (CoP), co-chaired by UNICEF Health, to complement and extend existing efforts to support the discovery, assessment and advancement of open source technologies with relevance to high-priority health areas. In order to effectively align and coordinate approaches, the CoP began defining and describing the relationship between digital public goods (DPGs) and global goods in the digital health context. This paper discusses the relationship between these two terms, setting the groundwork for effective coordination across the approaches of Digital Square, WHO and others.&nbsp;</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/dpg-globalgoods">Read the paper</a></div>



<p>Globally, significant progress has been made to harness the momentum of digital innovation and translate it to the healthcare sector. We’ve seen this, for example, in the unprecedented global cooperation on vaccine development. While these advancements are considerable, more must be done to support countries in their transition to digital health beyond the pandemic. COVID-19 has underscored the need for innovative solutions that have the ability to not only help countries respond, but also to strengthen digital cooperation and promote equitable access to health solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recognition of this need, in 2020 the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) convened a Health Community of Practice (CoP) with UNICEF Health which focused on identifying DPGs for immunization delivery management.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>The DPGA Community of Practice Model</strong></h5>



<p>The DPGA convenes expert CoPs to support the discovery, assessment and advancement of digital public goods (DPGs) with high potential for addressing critical development needs in low- and middle-income countries. Currently, there are ongoing CoPs for climate change adaptation, health, and financial inclusion. Within these broad topics, each CoP narrows in on particular focus areas by considering relevance and potential impact of DPGs.</p>



<h5><strong>Aligning Initiatives for Digital Health</strong></h5>



<p>Several organisations within the development sector have been working to identify and support digital health technologies including <a href="https://innovate.who.int/">WHO’s ClearingHouse </a>and <a href="https://digitalsquare.org/global-goods-guidebook">Digital Square’s Global Goods Guidebook</a>. Though there are differences in criteria across these initiatives (<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/dpg-globalgoods">discussed in the paper</a>), in the health context, global goods can be considered mature digital public goods, and there are considerable opportunities for alignment that have the potential to accelerate the discovery and adoption of global goods.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks, the DPGA will be releasing a list of solutions identified by this CoP that meet all of the criteria to be recognized as both digital public goods and global goods of high relevance for immunization delivery management.</p>

<h4><strong><em>Part I: Funding the technologies at the core</em></strong></h4>



<p><em>Even digital public goods that are in wide demand, and have proven their potential to address development needs in multiple countries, struggle to attract the contributions and financial support required to maintain and evolve over time. This blog considers how to change that through coordinated, sustainable grant funding. This is the first in a series of blogs exploring how to finance the digital public goods ecosystem.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>In the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) we believe that digital public goods (DPGs)* are essential to unlocking the full potential of digital technologies to enhance human welfare at scale. Their relevance to one or multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs), combined with their adoptability and adaptability, allows DPGs to strengthen international digital cooperation. Stakeholders can join forces to support solutions that address many of today’s greatest global challenges in critical areas such as health, education and climate change. DPGs are of particular importance for resource constrained countries looking to accelerate development through improving access to digital services.</p>



<p>Still, precisely due to their nature as “public goods” &#8211; which ensures that no one can prevent others from benefiting from them &#8211; DPGs can be difficult to fund through market mechanisms, and some of them should not have to prioritise generating profit.</p>



<p></p>



<h6><strong>Sustainable funding for the public good </strong></h6>



<p>The DPGA believes that DPGs with the highest potential to accelerate attainment of the SDGs in multiple countries should be sustainably funded in order to maximise the global public good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that sustainable grant funding is most critical for “infrastructural” DPGs that can be deployed as relevant parts of a country’s <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/accelerating-financial-inclusion-during-covid-19-and-beyond/">foundational or functional digital public infrastructures (DPIs)</a>. DPIs tend to be cross-sectorally enabling, serving as the rails that public and private service delivery can run on. They can therefore have a disproportionately positive impact on achieving the SDGs. Conversely, when DPIs are not well-designed and well-implemented, they can do harm to the economy and society. It is in the global public interest that they are built to serve society’s poor and marginalised groups, safeguard human rights, and enable a diverse and flourishing economic ecosystem. Stable grant funding for state-of-the-art infrastructural DPGs can help ensure this.</p>



<p></p>



<h6><strong>Building out ecosystems with infrastructural DPGs at the core</strong></h6>



<p>Sustainably funded infrastructural DPGs can become a reliable core for broader ecosystems through community building:</p>



<ul><li>For the <a href="https://www.mosip.io/">Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP)</a> core code management and evolution is fully funded by grants from a group of philanthropic and bilateral donors.** This enables the team responsible for managing and evolving the generic platform to focus exclusively on maximising utility for those the platform is designed to serve &#8211; in this case, countries in need of foundational digital identity systems.</li><li>Similarly backed by grant funding for core code development and maintenance, the team behind <a href="https://dhis2.org/">District Health Information Software 2</a> (DHIS2) has prioritised community building within and between the 70+ countries that have adopted the software, enabling countries to share improvements and related innovations. This is best exemplified by Sri Lanka, the first country in the world <a href="https://dhis2.org/sri-lanka-covid-surveillance/">to use DHIS2 for COVID-19 surveillance</a>, who shared this groundbreaking innovation with the global DHIS2 community. <a href="https://dhis2.org/covid-19/">Today</a>, this system is operational in 38 countries and is under development in fourteen more.</li><li>The data exchange layer <a href="https://x-road.global/">X-Road</a>, which is publicly funded by <a href="https://www.niis.org/">NIIS</a> members (currently Estonia and Finland), demonstrates how infrastructural DPGs can use community building to advance both the core technology and the  quality of downstream deployments. The <a href="https://x-road.global/community">X-Road Community</a> connects a diverse group of individuals and allows anyone to contribute to the open-source technology. This community-based support and knowledge-sharing helps local vendors around the world build the expertise needed to provide quality services to stakeholders adopting the technology.</li></ul>



<h6>More and better coordinated funding needed</h6>



<p>Since the creation of the DPGA in 2019, we have learned that while many stakeholders are individually doing great work that can help create a comprehensive and vibrant ecosystem built around infrastructural DPGs, it remains too limited and fragmented to usher in a paradigm shift. For that to happen, we must mobilise more resources both to strengthen existing financing instruments and to create new ones, while ensuring cross-coordination throughout different ecosystem-parts. The magnitude of this task is simply too large and complex in nature for any single entity to address all the challenges by itself.</p>



<p>As a multi-stakeholder alliance dedicated to the advancement of digital public goods, the DPGA is well placed to help build a partnership-oriented and coordinated funding model with infrastructural digital public goods at the core. We look forward to working with other stakeholders to shape this in the coming months. </p>



<h6><strong><em>The next part in this blog series</em></strong></h6>



<p><em>Funding infrastructural DPGs so that they can be built and maintained over time as generic “state-of-the art”, dependable and trustworthy technologies, is a critical first step to realising their full impact-potential. However, a sustainable funding model must also support countries to assess, implement and maintain DPGs. We will write about funding needs for country technical assistance in the next part of this blog series.</em></p>

<p>*Endorsed by the<a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/assets/pdf/Roadmap_for_Digital_Cooperation_EN.pdf"> UN Secretary General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>, the DPGA defines digital public goods as: “open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the SDGs.”</p>

<p><strong>This is the third in a four-part series featuring exciting work from the Co-Founders of the Digital Public Goods Alliance. </strong>This week we’re featuring Sierra Leone.</p>



<p> If you missed it, check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-1-meet-our-co-founders-ispirt-61f1f41d6642" target="_blank">Part 1 on iSPIRT</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/digital-public-goods/series-part-2-meet-our-co-founder-norway-1020112d1ad6" target="_blank">Part 2 on Norway</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sierra Leone&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>&nbsp;Sierra Leone’s Directorate of Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (DSTI) has highlighted how youth empowerment, economic reform and health infrastructure can open up regional possibilities. Like iSPIRT, Sierra Leone is leading by example, creating a virtuous cycle driven by their four pillars (Data for Decision Making, Service Delivery &amp; Citizen Engagement, Data Systems &amp; Technology Design, and Ecosystem Strengthening) that serve as a foundation to turn Sierra Leone into an innovation and entrepreneurship hub, that other developing countries can emulate.&nbsp;<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>The DSTI in particular is playing a key role by engaging private sector and university communities to help build the technology that makes the implementation of digital public goods possible. This comes from an understanding that, in order for DPGs to evolve at scale and with a lower barrier to entry, there needs to be a supportive ecosystem built up that addresses questions of resourcing and intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sierra Leone is also <a href="https://www.dsti.gov.sl/sierra-leone-national-innovation-digital-strategy-2019-2029">setting an example</a> by documenting their progress and lessons learned. DSTI gathers data to support policy and decision-making in the public interest and makes relevant data gathered throughout the process publicly available.&nbsp;</p>
