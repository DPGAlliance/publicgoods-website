When monitoring a public facility, the owner of the facility is present, and the project team immediately notifies him or her of which elements of the facility do not meet the standards for accessibility of facilities open to the public. On the portal \u201cAccessible Kazakhstan\u201d one can find checklists with criteria for assessing accessibility of facilities, so that, if desired, the owners can read them and afterwards be involved in monitoring independently. Upon request, the project team develops recommendations, on the basis of which owners and government agencies start working on the adaptation of particular facilities for the aforementioned categories of citizens. Based on current data on accessibility of public facilities, comprehensive policies and plans for inclusion can be adopted and implemented. This, in turn, will reduce inequalities and accelerate achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals that affect development of an inclusive society. The world community needs qualified specialists who are able to form a barrier-free environment. It is for the purpose of training such specialists in 2019 within the framework of the \u201cAccessible Kazakhstan\u201d project that a unique online course \u201cEnsuring accessibility of a public facility\u201d was developed.

Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.

Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda\u2019s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis\u2019 approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. \u201cWe attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,\u201d said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some partners pull out, saying: \u2018Our time here has elapsed.

Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes.

By using Zenysis\u2019 analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: \u201cIn public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.\u201d Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA)","evidenceURL":"https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/8705/publication_privatesectorzenysis_focuson_en.pdf"},{"SDGNumber":6,"evidenceText":"6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a \u201cvirtual control room\u201d, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations.

Similarly, reasonable accommodations are still in their infancy at corporates throughout the country. Specifically, for people with print disabilities, this leads to much of the content (e.g. textbooks, handouts etc.) as well as over 97.4% of webpages remaining inaccessible due to it being incompatible with assistive technologies. Covid-19 has further exacerbated this challenge with social distancing leading to lack of volunteers and online education leading to a proliferation in the creation and sharing of inaccessible digital content.

This project is the first step in this direction in being able to provide organizations and people with disabilities the tools they need to convert any inaccessible content into accessible format (including complex content such as math, multi-column layouts, tables etc.). This not only helps people with disabilities access content in a reliable and efficient manner but also substantially saves time, effort and money (by upto 70%) spent by organizations to remediate content.

Originally, KSO was designed for presenting the biological diversity on the seabed of Kosterhavets National Park on the Swedish West coast - an environment that is otherwise invisible to the public. Here you can find dead whales, flying feather stars, swimming scallops, large colourful sponges and starfish. Currently, the KSO system is upgraded and will soon also feature Baltic environments, while the analytical functions likewise expanding.","website":"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/victorav/the-koster-seafloor-observatory","license":[{"spdx":"GPL-3.0","licenseURL":"https://github.com/ocean-data-factory-sweden/koster_ml/blob/master/LICENSE"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":14,"evidenceText":"KSO contriuted to a global ocean observing system for marine biodiversity and anthropogenic effects "}],"sectors":[],"type":["software","aimodel"],"repositories":[{"name":"Github repository for the system data flow","url":"https://github.com/ocean-data-factory-sweden/koster_data_management"},{"name":"Github repository for the machine learning model","url":"https://github.com/ocean-data-factory-sweden/koster_ml"}],"organizations":[{"name":"University of Gothenburg, Swedish biodiversity Data Infrastructure","website":"https://biodiversitydata.se/","org_type":"maintainer","contact_name":"Matthias Obst","contact_email":"matthias.obst@marine.gu.se"}],"stage":"nominee","githubActivity":"<a href=\\"https://github.com/ocean-data-factory-sweden/koster_data_management\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span class=\\"tooltipped tooltipped-s\\" aria-label=\\"Past year of activity\\">\\n    <svg width=\\"155\\" height=\\"30\\">\\n      <defs>\\n        <linearGradient id=\\"gradient-243629646\\" x1=\\"0\\" x2=\\"0\\" y1=\\"1\\" y2=\\"0\\">\\n          <stop offset=\\"0%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L1-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"10%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L2-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"25%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L3-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"50%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L4-bg)\\"></stop>\\n        </linearGradient>\\n        <mask id=\\"sparkline-243629646\\" x=\\"0\\" y=\\"0\\" width=\\"155\\" height=\\"28\\">\\n          <polyline transform=\\"translate(0, 28) scale(1,-1)\\" points=\\"0,7.51 3,7.51 6,8.16 9,11.42 12,4.91 15,1.65 18,1.0 21,1.65 24,2.95 27,4.91 30,3.6 33,1.65 36,2.95 39,2.3 42,1.65 45,4.26 48,3.6 51,21.84 54,7.51 57,10.12 60,3.6 63,6.86 66,11.42 69,8.16 72,2.95 75,4.26 78,6.21 81,5.56 84,2.95 87,3.6 90,1.65 93,5.56 96,6.21 99,1.0 102,1.0 105,2.3 108,1.0 111,1.0 114,5.56 117,11.42 120,4.91 123,5.56 126,29.0 129,13.37 132,7.51 135,1.0 138,5.56 141,3.6 144,2.3 147,1.65 150,1.65 153,1.0 \\" fill=\\"transparent\\" stroke=\\"#8cc665\\" stroke-width=\\"2\\">\\n        </polyline></mask>\\n      </defs>\\n\\n      <g transform=\\"translate(0, 2.0)\\">\\n        <rect x=\\"0\\" y=\\"-2\\" width=\\"155\\" height=\\"30\\" style=\\"stroke: none; fill: url(#gradient-243629646); mask: url(#sparkline-243629646)\\"></rect>\\n      </g>\\n    </svg>\\n  </span>\\n</a>","dpgLink":false},{"name":"Kotani Pay","aliases":[""],"description":"Kotani Pay is a stablecoin to fiat off-ramp and off-ramp service.

The platform targets to provide equal accessibility for all people, with special focus on the vulnerable population- people with disabilities, people in geographically vulnerable areas, minor ethnic groups. In addition to facilitating equal accessibility to skills development for all, the platform incorporates academia supported career counseling, AI based career guidance, educational skills in blended mode to further ensure quality education.

This is a real-time data driven matchmaking platform for the stakeholders of skills development, employment generation, and entrepreneurship to minimize the gap between supply and demand in the labor market to accomplish SDG 8.5 (Full employment and decent work with equal pay) and SDG 8.6 (Promote youth employment, education and training). This platform is designed to mitigate the challenges of skills mismatch that ultimately contributes to reducing unemployment problem and increases the efficiency of the labor market. To increase employability for the youth, NISE offers them accessibility to career counselling and guidance, job forecast, apprenticeship opportunities, business and entrepreneurship guidance, migration suggestions, etc. The platform\u2019s real-time data enables the public and private skills service providers to analyze and identify the skills in demand and forecast future jobs so that they can plan their activities accordingly. To further reduce this supply-demand gap, the platform facilitates the industries to advertise job vacancies to specific audience, receive skilled youth, and maintain a supply-demand relationship with skills providers to simplify information sharing amongst them on emerging job opportunities, skilled HR, and market driven skills. Thus, NISE is essentially making impacts in economic development by preparing a demand driven skilled workforce. Youths equipped with proper skills will ultimately be able to secure decent and gainful employment not only in own country but also in abroad by ensuring skilled and safe migration and get equal pay as per their skillsets."},{"SDGNumber":17,"evidenceText":"Youth unemployment is a global challenge, posing newer threats in the post COVID reality.

Most of these youth belong to the least-developed and developing countries where supply-demand gap is the key indicator of such unemployment issue. NISE has already been replicated in Somalia and Jordan to solve similar problem in these countries. The platform has received a number of global recognition and a few countries have shown interest to replicate it in their countries. NISE, if becomes an open-source platform, can contribute in achieving SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals) as it may be replicated in other least-developed and developing countries in south-south and triangular cooperation to enhance their capacity to achieve previously mentioned SDGs by providing skills development, employment and entrepreneurship support."}],"sectors":[],"type":["software"],"repositories":[{"name":"Front End","url":"https://github.com/nise3/Client-Web-Apps.git"},{"name":"Core API","url":"https://github.com/nise3/Core-API-Service.git"},{"name":"CMS API","url":"https://github.com/nise3/CMS-API-Service.git"},{"name":"Youth API","url":"https://github.com/nise3/Youth-API-Service.git"},{"name":"SSP API","url":"https://github.com/nise3/TSP-API-Service.git"},{"name":"Industry API","url":"https://github.com/nise3/Industry-Association-API-Service.git"},{"name":"Payment API","url":"https://github.com/nise3/Payment-And-Invoice-Service.git"},{"name":"Mail & SMS API","url":"https://github.com/nise3/Mail-and-SMS-Service.git"},{"name":"Documentation","url":"https://github.com/nise3/Documentation.git"}],"organizations":[{"name":"Aspire to Innovate (a2i)","website":"https://a2i.gov.bd/","org_type":"owner","contact_name":"Md.

OpenMRS, as an open-source project, provides a unique solution which puts local providers and patients at the center of their health information ecosystem.

Barriers to inclusion and participation are exacerbated by the lack of access to affordable, relevant assistive technology. According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in people with disabilities engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability. Digital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure \'no one is left behind\' in our increasingly digital world.

Currently we live in a technological age where children and adolescents live a normality that consists of the use of technological tools. They get bored easily, the way in which information is presented to them is not very motivating and school is no longer the only means of access to education. There are different tools through which they can acquire knowledge, however the minimum has a pedagogical basis. Due to the aforementioned, we must innovate in the teaching-learning process. Currently there are new teaching methodologies, with a focus on active learning and the development of skills through play. One of these methodologies is gamification. Different authors define it as a process in which game mechanisms are used to attract people, promote learning and solve problems. The purpose is to motivate the player\'s behavior. Elements in the game such as points, avatars or levels, increase the psychological predisposition of the player to continue in it. This makes gamification an ally of education. Currently there are game developers who use platforms like Godot, however they do not have the pedagogical knowledge to add elements that help the user to consolidate their learning. That\'s why Pixframe Studios is developing a plugin for the Godot Engine: a tool to help new game developers and serious game teams create new games with the goal of aiding in the development of education. As mentioned before, Latin America is still trying to develop new tools to improve their educational field, nevertheless they don\'t have enough knowledge nor tools to achieve it. The plugin is open source so that the community in Latin America can access new ways of creating video games with a pedagogical basis. In this way, code is created, optimized and shared. Educational material can be shared in an innovative way and finally a stock of illustrative material is generated such as button icons, backgrounds for games, fonts and unique Godot Engine assets."}],"sectors":["Education"],"type":["software"],"repositories":[{"name":"towi","url":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot"}],"organizations":[{"name":"Pixframe Studios","website":"https://pixframestudios.com/","org_type":"owner","contact_name":"David Casillas","contact_email":"dc@pixframestudios.com"}],"stage":"DPG","githubActivity":"<a href=\\"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span class=\\"tooltipped tooltipped-s\\" aria-label=\\"Past year of activity\\">\\n    <svg width=\\"155\\" height=\\"30\\">\\n      <defs>\\n        <linearGradient id=\\"gradient-476885112\\" x1=\\"0\\" x2=\\"0\\" y1=\\"1\\" y2=\\"0\\">\\n          <stop offset=\\"0%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L1-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"10%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L2-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"25%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L3-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"50%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L4-bg)\\"></stop>\\n        </linearGradient>\\n        <mask id=\\"sparkline-476885112\\" x=\\"0\\" y=\\"0\\" width=\\"155\\" height=\\"28\\">\\n          <polyline transform=\\"translate(0, 28) scale(1,-1)\\" points=\\"0,1 3,1 6,1 9,1 12,1 15,1 18,1 21,1 24,1 27,1 30,1 33,1 36,1 39,1 42,1 45,1 48,1 51,1 54,1 57,1 60,5 63,1 66,4 69,1 72,5 75,1 78,19 81,1 84,2 87,1 90,1 93,1 96,1 99,1 102,1 105,4 108,1 111,1 114,1 117,1 120,1 123,1 126,1 129,1 132,1 135,1 138,1 141,1 144,2 147,1 150,2 153,1 \\" fill=\\"transparent\\" stroke=\\"#8cc665\\" stroke-width=\\"2\\">\\n        </polyline></mask>\\n      </defs>\\n\\n      <g transform=\\"translate(0, -3)\\">\\n        <rect x=\\"0\\" y=\\"-2\\" width=\\"155\\" height=\\"30\\" style=\\"stroke: none; fill: url(#gradient-476885112); mask: url(#sparkline-476885112)\\"></rect>\\n      </g>\\n    </svg>\\n  </span>\\n</a>","dpgLink":true},{"name":"Translation Initiative for Covid-19","aliases":["TICO-19"],"description":"Academic and industry partners are collaborating with Translators without Borders to provide machine-readable translation data related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas.
