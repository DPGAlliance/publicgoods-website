If the user logs in or registers on the website, one automatically consents to the data collection and processing. When registering, we exercise the user\u2019s right to know about the purposes of collection, methods and terms of processing personal information by means of giving a user the opportunity to familiarize oneself with our Privacy policy and Terms of service. We ensure confidentiality of user personal data by complying with the requirement to prevent their dissemination without the user\u2019s consent or another legal basis. Additionally, the administrator revises the privacy policy on a monthly basis and, if necessary, supplements it.

Legal measures include an agreement on the confidentiality of personal data concluded by the owner of the information system, which establishes the conditions for work, access and use of personal data, as well as responsibility for their violation. Technical measures include the use of information security tools: An SSL certificate is connected to our website. It guarantees a secure connection between the user\'s browser and the server.

On the portal \u201cAccessible Kazakhstan\u201d one can find checklists with criteria for assessing accessibility of facilities, so that, if desired, the owners can read them and afterwards be involved in monitoring independently.

Based on current data on accessibility of public facilities, comprehensive policies and plans for inclusion can be adopted and implemented. This, in turn, will reduce inequalities and accelerate achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals that affect development of an inclusive society. The world community needs qualified specialists who are able to form a barrier-free environment. It is for the purpose of training such specialists in 2019 within the framework of the \u201cAccessible Kazakhstan\u201d project that a unique online course \u201cEnsuring accessibility of a public facility\u201d was developed.

A collaboration led by researchers at the University of Washington and supported by Medic conducted a literature review focused on data protection regulations and guidance for best practices in responsible data, including such issues as informed consent and means of anticipating unintentional harms related to secondary analysis of data. This was followed by a participatory process to re-organize a range of legal documents used by Medic when it serves in the role of Data Processor in support of a Data Controlling Entity such as a government.

Many of these studies were reviewed by Institutional Review Boards in the settings where we work (such as the Kenya Medical Research Institute IRB) and global universities (such as the University of Washington IRB). These review processes, and the careful thorough approach undertaken by our research collaborators are critical tools we use to identify and address potential unintended harms. More information about these publications is available at the following link: http://medic.org/publications/ Privacy policy is different per app, it is the responsibility of the Data Controlling Entity to establish such policies.

In CHT apps that support messaging with patients, the relevant patients are enrolled and consented into the process by a trained health worker. To our knowledge there have not been any deployments of CHT apps in which minors were enrolled in use of the system. One of the four core principles of the CHT community is that we are committed to designing CHT systems in a human-centered manner. In our view, this is not merely a buzzword or a statement of ethical priorities. Rather, it is a set of rigorous methods that work within a flexible yet disciplined process to prioritize people\u2019s needs and concrete experiences in the design of digital systems. An essential feature of human-centered design is that it prioritizes the dignity and agency of end users. It is also explicitly iterative and takes responsibility for making adaptations to address any potential unintended effects of a system - such as a situation in which health workers might experience grief or abuse from a peer or supervisor via their digital tool. We have conducted extensive research and members of our team are considered global authorities on the topic of human-centered design for global health, we consider this approach to be a thorough and substantive means of addressing lived experiences of harassment and abuse in health systems.

It is also used by the RBM Partnership to End Malaria for global coordination of the malaria response. Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank\u2019s classification.   ,&#013; &#010;3. Good Health and Well-being Evidence: Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various disease areas within the health sector, including but not limited to, for national and sub-national HIV, TB, and Malaria programs. Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data has been integrated, it is being used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: \u201cZenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,\u201d John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. \u201cThis model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda\u2019s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis\u2019 approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. \u201cWe attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,\u201d said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some partners pull out, saying: \u2018Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.\u2019\u201d ,&#013; &#010;5. Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis\u2019 software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis\u2019 analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: \u201cIn public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.\u201d Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA),&#013; &#010;6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a \u201cvirtual control room\u201d, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an \u201cmAlert system\u201d, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique\u2019s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.,&#013; &#010;8. Decent Work and Economic Growth Evidence: Zenysis is working with the Jobs Creation Commission (JCC) to establish a Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform to help the government manage and monitor its job creation programs. The platform, supported by Big Win Philanthropy, brings together a number of data sources to generate insights for policymakers, employers, job seekers and employment agencies.  Excerpt from Big Win Philanthropy Article: During this meeting, the delegation also learned about Ethiopia\u2019s Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform, developed by Zenysis Technologies to facilitate evidence-based decision-making through aggregating employment data from different information systems. Now in its second phase of expansion, the platform aggregates more than 20 data sources including job creation reports, education data, and labor force and employment surveys to create a national employment database and verify the accuracy of reports received from a variety of sources.,&#013; &#010;17. Partnerships for the Goals Evidence: The integration of data across multiple once siloed systems supports the partnership and coordination of both domestic and international stakeholders in each Harmony deployment. For example, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria is the largest global platform for coordinated action towards a world free from malaria and since July 2019, Zenysis Technologies has been working with the RBM partnership to enhance data sharing, coordination and action in the fight against malaria. Zenysis has developed the Global Malaria Monitoring Dashboard to strengthen regional and global reporting requirements, integrate data from different systems, and improve data visualization and management tools. The dashboards integrate epidemiological, programmatic, financial, supply chain, and other data from more than 30 countries."},"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Zenysis Technologies Inc.","clearOwnershipURL":"https://www.zenysis.com/#harmony"}],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":[" Harmony comes with various guidelines"," protocols"," and tools to help prevent risks and ultimately avoid harm.

Users also have the ability to connect with Zenysis staff through various channels (in-platform, email, in-person, phone etc) in country or globally, if the user finds any issues utilizing our software or when dealing with contributors or when building the software. In the future, Zenysis will plan to have a Harmony Community of Practice, which will include age limits for participation and community guidelines that provide a code of conduct and governance for the community. The Zenysis team will create both automated and non-automated processes to flag inappropriate behavior, risk, harassment or any other deleterious actions or posts by users or contributors.  Currently Harmony contributors and users interact through Zenysis\' facilitation. E.g. A country\'s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) manager may want a new feature in Harmony, which is discussed and supported through Zenysis\u2019 engineering and product teams. Thus, at this time, any user that interacts with a contributor is known to Zenysis and does not include underage users. Furthermore, as noted above, access to data at the indicator level, dashboards, analyses, and other functionality can be delegated on a per-user basis.

These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an \'in-progress\' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems. Although not currently a recognised standard, we hope that these extensions become de-facto standards over time as their implementation becomes more widespread. OpenCRVS has been developed together with the support of a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), comprising a wide variety of international experts in the domain of civil registration and vital statistics, which has the following responsibilities:\\n1. Provide strategic advice for the overall direction and positioning of the OpenCRVS product.\\n2. Help identify short, medium and long term priorities for OpenCRVS product development.\\n3. Share experiences and documentation of CRVS that can be used to inform the development of the product e.g. lessons learnt, requirements, and useful contacts.\\n4. Support OpenCRVS research and policy development activities through working group or individual contributions.\\n5. Support in the development of the sustainability model for OpenCRVS.\\n6. Conduct additional research that will support development of OpenCRVS.\\n7. Peer review technical, functional design standards and content to be used for the development of OpenCRVS.\\n8. Advise compliance with relevant existing standards, including introductions to other relevant network and standardization bodies.\\nMinutes of the TAG meetings can be found here:\\nhttps://www.opencrvs.org/about-us\\nThe UN guidelines for civil registration and vital statistics systems provide a very comprehensive basis to support governments to build, operate and maintain effective civil registration systems that prevent doing harm. These UN guidelines should be used in conjunction with any OpenCRVS implementation and can be found here: https://www.un.org/development/desa/capacity-development/tools/tool/principles-and-recommendations-for-a-vital-statistics-system-revision-3/\\nWe engage with the OpenCRVS community so that vulnerabilities and risks can be continuously monitored. We have hosted webinars with this community to capture feedback from across the civil registration community.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a global standard security framework built on a role-based permissions management model that manages access at both the broad and granular levels by aligning the assigned permissions role with the organizational role of the user. RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \\n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication. PKI governs the issuance of digital certificates to protect sensitive data, provide unique digital identities for users, devices, and applications, and secure end-to-end communications. \\n- Reveals\u2019 infrastructure \xeds protected and encapsulated within a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Access to these components is governed via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), implementing the OpenVPN protocol. OpenVPN is an open-source VPN that is commonly used for creating Point-to-Point and Site-to-Site connections. It uses a traditional security protocol based on the  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. \\n - Data transmission between Reveal Android client and Reveal Server is protected by the TLS encryption protocol.

UNBL contains several relevant layers associated with the SDG.  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for crops and flooded vegetation. Example: The Marine Priority Areas for Food Security layer identifies priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision and carbon storage.  Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03371-z  Example: the Crop Suitability Change layer shows general agricultural suitability considering rain-fed conditions and irrigation on currently irrigated areas.The dataset covers two time periods (2011-2040, 2071-2100), as well as changes in agricultural suitability over two periods (1981-2100, 2011-2100). Example layer in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL provides a number of layers related to water provision and essential watersheds.  Example: The Nature Map Realised Clean Water Provision layer consists of a globally normalized map (from 0 to 1) of pixels ranked for their relative importance in delivering clean water to downstream beneficiaries. Example: The City Water Map layer contains information on the water sources for 534 cities internationally. The watershed layer shown here includes information about the catchment area of the watershed that supplies these cities.  Example layer in link below.,&#013; &#010;Mapping urban areas, and trends in urban development is relevant here. At 10m scale users can also start to identify large green spaces in urban areas and agricultural peripheries. UNBL provides a number of layers related to this.  Example: The Global Grid of Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030 layer presents spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land cover change from 2000 to 2030 at a 2.5 arc-minute resolution.

Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to nature-based solutions for climate change.  Example layer included in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas. UNBL draws protected area data directly from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).

If you work for an organization, a school, or a therapy center that uses VRapeutic services, your\xa0domain administrator who manage your account will have access to your VRapeutic Account.,- FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING. We provide personal information to our\xa0affiliates\xa0and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer support.,- FOR LEGAL REASONS. We will share personal information outside of VRapeutic if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation,\xa0legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our\xa0Transparency Report.,\\nWe do not share the performance data of the users with any third party other than the third party that we adopt for data storage which is Microsoft Azure. Actually, we use Azure not just to store the users\u2019 data but also to store our library of VR modules. Equipment-Related Risks \\n - Possible overheating of VR headsets: We strictly adopt headsets that have an accessible document for Declaration of Conformity, e.g., CE certification. Our Terms of Use also indicate clearly that we don\u2019t permit our clients to use non-CE-certified headsets. Also, our user instructions explicitly mention the maximum duration of allowable continuous operation on a VR headset with a single user/child which specifically addresses the overheating concern. Finally, we recommend to our clients a wide spectrum of alternatives, with regards to VR headsets, on which we test all our VR modules prior to product delivery. \\n- Hardware-Software compatibility: We should always make sure that the developed software is compatible with the processor of the headset in terms of computational efficiency. Otherwise, the content would be poorly rendered with noticeable flickering, which impacts the user experience remarkably and biases the results. Since we develop the curriculum in house, we recommend to the clients the headsets on which the curriculum is tested by our team. Moreover, to mitigate this risk, we provide our product on a wide variety of headsets, with a wide range of costs, mainly to give the client the flexibility of choice according to their budget and accepted experience quality. \\n\\nOperational Risks \\n- Potential dizziness effects on users: Our safety policy and user instructions strictly mentions that our system is not allowed to be used without a physically-existing supervisor. If the sessions are taking place on-premises so the specialist is the supervisor, and if the session is taking place at home, so the specialist is supervising remotely but a guardian is accompanying the child physically. This is mainly to remove the headset in case dizziness has been observed. Also, our user instructions explicitly mentions the maximum duration of allowable usage on a VR headset with a single user/child which addresses the dizziness concern. Finally, we only adopt VR headsets with explicit dizziness instructions for the users including Oculus, Pico, and Gear VR. \\n- Potential habituation if not enough scenarios are developed and used: Our product plan takes into consideration the development of an ever-growing library of modules that takes into account the diversity of interests, social scenarios, acceptable difficulty levels, and the age range. This minimizes the possibility of habituation. There are several system design decisions that have been taken to guarantee the privacy of the users and the security of their data. This includes but is not limited to data anonymization, classification, and encryption. We also define a specific access level and scope for each type of users. Azure Information Protection is one of the services we use on Azure to define and implement encryption, identity, and authorization policies."},"protectionFromHarassment":{"facilitatesUserInteraction":"Yes","harassmentPolicy":"Our Terms of Service prohibit an underage user to access the system without an accompanying adult supervisor.,In case this happens, the child still will not be able to access the system since the desktop app controlling the VR modules is not installed on the child/users\u2019 side but on the therapist\u2019s side.

As the product needs to be improved further"," we are working with other researchers and scoping for funding opportunities\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Design for Scale\\r\\nWe are now closely working with other researchers to further improve AEDES. We want to expand the functionalities of AEDES and incorporate a dengue risk index. We have used the MVC Framework (Model"," View"," Controller) which isolates application functionality into self-contained components. We also utilized the API from Sentinel Copernicus Satellites to get satellite images with vast date ranges.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.Build for Sustainability\\r\\nSince the data captured is from global and public remote sensing service"," the application can continue gathering data. There is a plan to create a social enterprise around the dengue prediction service"," by incorporating other risk frameworks"," we can generalize the process and ensure that other indicators will also be integrated. The results and/or insights will be offered on a subscription basis.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Be Data Driven\\r\\nData"," as it moves along its value chain from creation to actionable insights"," underpins the overall workflow of AEDES.

X-Road is open-source software and it provides developing countries with a national data exchange infrastructure without licensing fees. By implementing X-Road, countries avoid a vendor lock-in situation and get multiple channels for support, including a global community of users.,\\r\\n \\r\\nDifferent healthcare platforms can be connected securely with X-Road which enables data exchange between private and public service providers. All the evidence regarding the data exchange is stored locally by the data exchange parties, and no third parties have access to the data. Steps are being taken to introduce X-Road on a global basis, to allow either the World Health Organization (WHO) or its member states to set up various cross-border services to help the global community emerge faster from the COVID-19 health and economic crisis.,\\r\\n \\r\\nEnergy efficiency, renewables and consumer centricity figure among the lines of action to boost the transition towards cleaner energy systems \u2013 ways of producing, delivering and consuming energy in a more sustainable way. The deployment of information technology has a significant impact on the feasibility of contemporary policy actions. X-Road is helping electricity grid operators by harmonising access to energy data. By simplifying access to data lets them focus on the solutions to achieve energy and climate goals.,\\r\\n \\r\\nX-Road enables reduction of administrative burdens by the implementation of the Once-Only Principle (TOOP). Streamlined administrative processes support economic growth and enable providing better services for the citizens. For example, in Estonia, X-Road saved 1,134 working years during the previous calendar year. X-Road helps a country to become a hassle-free environment for business and entrepreneurship, which also attracts foreign investments.,\\r\\n \\r\\nX-Road provides national core digital infrastructure for data exchange between organizations across administration sectors and business domains. Typically, the ecosystem is open for all kinds of organizations \u2013 both public and private sector organizations. Besides, X-Road can be used to implement cross-border data exchange with other countries. X-Road enables allocating resources for building digital services and fostering innovation, instead of integrating services point-to-point.,\\r\\n \\r\\nThe use of digital services reduces the need to travel between different locations which reduces traffic in the cities. When travelling is needed, digital services provide information about different transportation and route alternatives and may prioritise the most environmentally friendly alternatives. X-Road is a crucial enabler that\u2019s needed to make numerous information systems to communicate with each other. By establishing or joining an X-Road environment, cities and municipalities can request up-to-date information from relevant public registers and increase their effectiveness.,\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) aims to develop X-Road the most sustainable data exchange solution in the world. The short-term goal is to focus on the X- Road software\'s direct and tangible environmental impacts. NIIS conducted research focusing on assessing the current emissions profile across X-Road\'s operations and services to give targeted recommendations for emissions reduction and sustainable business practices.,\\r\\n \\r\\nX-Road is a solution to fight against corruption and helps in building trust towards institutions. X-Road provides log records of each message sent between X-Road ecosystem member organisations. The log records provide undeniable evidence of a transaction, and they could be used in process automation to reduce manual work, increase the level of automation in various processes and make things easier for both users of different information systems and citizens. X-Road also provides many features that are required from MyData platform technology."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"MIT","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/LICENSE"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS)","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/LICENSE"}],"NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"The non-PII data can be exported from the system using the X-Road Operational Monitoring Protocol:\\r\\nhttps://docs.x-road.global/OperationalMonitoring/Protocols/pr-opmon_x-road_operational_monitoring_protocol_Y-1096-2.html"},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["https://www.niis.org/blog/2018/5/27/x-road-logs-basics"],"dataPrivacySecurity":"https://x-road.global/security"},"userContent":{"contentManagement":"Content is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","contentTypes":["https://www.niis.org/blog/2018/5/27/x-road-logs-basics"],"contentManagementPolicy":"It is the sole responsibility of the governing authorities in each country that deploy the X-Road data exchange layer.

Design with the user.\\r\\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.","II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \\r\\n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape"," and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \\r\\n This is very important to us. To this end"," the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \\r\\n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning"," funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service"," we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \\r\\n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations"," monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI. Use open standards"," open data"," open source and open innovation. \\r\\n Met Norway has an open data policy"," and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards"," e.g http"," geojson"," openapi.","VII. Reuse and improve. \\r\\n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr"," the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \\r\\n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together"," making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns"," but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel"," and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.","IX. Be collaborative. \\r\\n - Building the service is continuously done through a close collaboration between IT personnel and geoscience researchers (meteorological and computational co-design). \\r\\n - The interface to the service was created in close collaboration with important users of our service."],"aliases":"","deploymentCountriesDepartments":"","otherDeploymentOrganisations":"","awardsReceived":"","githubActivity":"","dpgLink":true},{"aliases":["PvERS II"],"sectors":[],"stage":"DPG","privacy":[{"privacyCompliance":"Kenya Standards and Guidelines for E-Health Systems Interoperability: https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TB28.pdf,The Kenya Data Protection Act 2019: https://www.odpc.go.ke/dpa-act/,General Data Protection Regulation Privacy Policy:https://web.pharmacyboardkenya.org/terms-and-conditions/,Cookie\'s consent: https://web.pharmacyboardkenya.org/pharmacovigilance/","privacyComplianceURL":"https://www.met.no/en/About-us/privacy\\r\\nhttps://developer.yr.no/doc/TermsOfService/"}],"organizations":[{"name":"Pharmacovigilance Electronic Reporting Tool","website":"https://pv.pharmacyboardkenya.org/","org_type":"owner","contact_name":" Steven Wanyee Macharia  ","contact_email":"swanyee@intellisoftkenya.com"}],"platformIndependence":{"isPlatformIndependent":"No","openAlternatives":[]},"description":"PvERS II is a web and mobile based solution which provides reporting and surveillance functionalities of  individual case study reports (ICSR) and consumer reporting in pharmacovigilance.","website":"https://pv.pharmacyboardkenya.org/","openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"GPL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"SDG3: Good Health and Well-Being"}],"sdgs":{"sdg":["SDG3: Good Health and Well-Being"],"relevance":"The solution is focused in supporting the development and research of safe vaccines/drugs by providing a way for all consumers to report on adverse effects they may experience in the use of medical products.

OpenSPP is currently being deployed in the Middle East to support a country-wide government in-kind transfer program that targets the most vulnerable populations (helping towards the achievement of Target 1.3).,&#013; &#010;OpenSPP can be used to distribute food assistance to the most vulnerable populations thanks to offline registration and advance targeting of qualified beneficiaries. MUAC monitoring for mother and child can be implemented to distribute specialized nutritious foods to prevent stunting in children under 5 of age (helping towards the achievement of Target 2.2). OpenSPP is currently being deployed in the Middle East to support a country-wide government in-kind transfer program that targets the most vulnerable populations (helping towards the achievement of Target 2.1).,&#013; &#010;OpenSPP can be used to implement various types of health and well-being programs, from antenatal and postnatal programs to ensure maternal and child well-being to the distribution of health and hygiene kits. For instance, programs can be configured to implement cash or food distribution in the context of MUAC monitoring for mother and child (helping towards the achievement of Targets 3.1 and 3.2).,&#013; &#010;OpenSPP can be used to implement attendance tracking in school feeding programs that provide both educational and health benefits to the most vulnerable children. School feeding programs act as an incentive for families to enroll and keep children in school (helping towards the achievement of Targets 4.1 and 4.2).,&#013; &#010;From intent and design to implementation, OpenSPP allows for the integration of gender considerations into all aspects of a social protection program (helping towards the achievement of Target 5.1). The platform can also be used to create and manage school feeding programs that, according to WFP, empower girls by dissuading parents from marrying them off early, which halts their education and can result in child pregnancies.,&#013; &#010;From intent and design to implementation, OpenSPP allows for the integration of inequality considerations into all aspects of a social protection program, helping beneficiaries receive what they need. OpenSPP helps governments implement and monitor social protection policies (helping towards the achievement of Target 10.4).,&#013; &#010;OpenSPP is developed by people in the Global South (Thailand, the Philippines, Laos, and Vietnam) for the Global South (helping towards the achievement of Targets 17.6 and 17.9), and it allows and encourages local companies to provide support for the solution. OpenSPP is particularly well suited to provide support to developing countries to significantly increase the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts (helping towards the achievement of Target 17.I)."},"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/openspp-project/openspp-registry,https://github.com/openspp-project/openspp-program,https://github.com/openspp-project/openspp-grievance-redress-mechanism,https://github.com/openspp-project/documentation,https://github.com/openspp-project/openspp-docker"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"OpenSPP","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/openspp-project/openspp-program/blob/15.0/COPYRIGHT"}],"documentation":"https://docs.openspp.org/","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"OpenSPP follows a role-based access control approach.

Preventing Errors:\\n - \\nE-Heza\'s decision logic model and all aspects of clinical care are governed by a clinical review process that includes physicians, healthcare workers, and digital health specialists. This work is reviewed by the E-Heza Executive committee. \\n- Development work is open source and follows a peer review process in which all code is first reviewed by another developer before it is submitted to the QA process. \\n- E-Heza adheres to best practices  privacy and data security standards to ensure the protection of private patient information. \\n2. Learning from mistakes: \\n- TIP Global Health\'s Model is based on gathering feedback and acting on it. There is a regular process of understanding challenges and potential errors which may cause harm. (https://tipglobalhealth.org/our-model/) \\n- The feedback process is governed by the E-Heza Executive committee and overseen by the TIP Global Health Steering Committee. \\n3. Promoting a culture of safety through safe practices and safe systems. \\n - E-Heza\u2019s training model is built to encourage co-design and encourages the foundational feedback mechanisms in order to understand both errors of omission and errors of commission. TIP  Global Health takes the following steps to ensure the privacy and security of data collected: \\n- Healthcare workers sign and commit to a \u201cProtected Health Information Confidentiality Agreement\u201d and receive initial and ongoing training regarding privacy and security. \\n - Access to E-Heza\u2019s backend (where private data is held) is secured with role-based permission access and only site administrators with proper need are given access to private data. \\n- Transfer of data between E-Heza\u2019s front-end client and backend storage is through SSL-encrypted channels only and performed only with authenticated devices. \\n- E-Heza maintains an access log which tracks all access and both to backend accounts and front end data collection. Weekly audits are performed on the access logs, and the  logs are maintained for one year (and then archived through the prescribed backup retention plan). \\n- E-Heza\u2019s development operation prohibits the use of non-anonymized data in the development process. No developer may hold personal information on their local system to transfer any personal information from a non-production environment outside the course of the normal backup procedure. \\n - E-Heza engages in third-party security audits in order to procure recommendations for further privacy and security procedures."},"userContent":{"contentManagement":"Content is NOT collected NOT stored and NOT distributed.","contentTypes":[],"contentManagementPolicy":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"facilitatesUserInteraction":"Yes","harassmentPolicy":"E-Heza is designed to be used only by healthcare workers and implementing organizations are responsible for screening healthcare workers for age.

Create user personas: was undertaken at inception point. The UI/UX designer in collaboration with the Oky team created profiles of the target audience. \\r\\n2. Develop and validate user scenarios: test cases where written which cover main user journeys and scenarios. During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019"," the main user cases were tested by Oky\'s target users. \\r\\n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars"," colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \\r\\n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \\r\\n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example"," in Indonesia"," encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \\r\\n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal & invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. It\u2019s theory of change includes scaling. In addition"," Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \\r\\n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition"," there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Oky\u2019s privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards"," open source. \\r\\n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \\r\\n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance"," both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI"," as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition"," to comply with W3C privacy standards"," the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also"," as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English"," Bahasa"," Mongolian and some more to be coming too)"," it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian"," Latin alphabet etc.","Finally"," to keep user\'s data safe"," Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials.

One of the most common use cases of the resulting API is for government agencies and NGOs to deploy simulators enabling citizens to assess which benefits they are entitled to, allowing them to obtain the social support they should get but too often don\'t because of lack of information and actionability.\\r\\n\\tExamples: https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr (France), https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/rac-legal-eligibility/ (New Zealand), https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/lesmevesajudes/ (Spain), https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/campaign/savings-finder (Australia).\\r\\n\\tImpact assessment in France: https://blog.beta.gouv.fr/general/2019/11/18/mes-aides-metriques/; https://blog.beta.gouv.fr/dinsic/2017/05/03/mes-aides-datascience-public/.\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca also improves personal finance and budgeting ability, by enabling any service provider or assistant to compute personal financial obligations and entitlements and predict their evolution across potential life events.\\r\\n\\tExamples: https://pa-comp.firebaseapp.com/ ; https://www.benefitme.nz/ ; https://betagouv.github.io/mes-aides-changent/graphique/?source=/mes-aides-changent/static/celibataire_handicap.json\\r\\n- 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth\\r\\n\\tBy making social and fiscal legislation executable, OpenFisca empowers individuals and businesses to assess their best employment opportunities, by removing the guesswork in computing exact income after tax and total cost to the employer. It also eases the creation and expansion of businesses in full respect of the law, by clarifying how regulatory constraints apply specifically to a given context.\\r\\n\\tExamples: https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/community-gaming/community-gaming-regulation-check/ (context: https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/article/an-australian-first-nsw-translating-rules-as-code-to-make-compliance-easy) ; https://www.simucrea.fr.\\r\\n- 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure\\r\\n\\tBeyond all the examples listed in other points, that demonstrate how OpenFisca enables innovation and is the central part of an upcoming critical digital infrastructure, APIs based on OpenFisca can model many types of legislation, including niche ones, enabling lawmakers, regulators, and businesses to share a common view of their entitlements and duties and to discuss potential evolutions.\\r\\n\\tExamples: Mining taxes in France are modeled in https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france-fiscalite-miniere; the Australian Energy Saving Scheme is modeled in https://www.codeforaustralia.org/case-studies/dpie-rules-as-code, and its National Building Code is being prototyped in a similar fashion.\\r\\n- 10: Reduced Inequalities (within and between countries)\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca supports citizens in assessing their benefits, thus improving access to social safety nets designed for reducing inequalities (cf. SDG1).\\r\\n\\tBeyond that aspect, by consolidating historical legislative data and enabling large-scale, population-wide simulations, OpenFisca enables economists, researchers, NGOs, and lawmakers to assess the impact of existing schemes and potential reforms, improving the understanding of policies impact on inequality and accelerating the delivery of policies to reduce it effectively.\\r\\n\\tExamples: The French Institut des Politiques Publiques measured the impact of 5 years of consolidated fiscal reforms on wealth distribution, and was able to reach that level of precision thanks to OpenFisca: https://www.ipp.eu/en/publication/february-2020-budget-2020-what-effects-on-households/; https://budget.ipp.eu; https://policyengine.org/uk/blog/2023-01-12-from-idea-to-impact-scoring-a-policy-reform-on-the-new-policyengine-uk\\r\\n\\tWith growing OpenFisca adoption, cross-country comparison of implementations of similar policies becomes possible: with a simple mapping of the name of each policy in their respective OpenFisca model, researchers can run simulations over multiple years and populations and compare the results of each policy, enabling identification of the most effective ones.\\r\\n\\tAn upcoming European Union-funded Multi-Country Project also considers modeling international business rules and taxation, enabling identification and correction of policies that place an undue burden on individuals and businesses operating across countries.\\r\\n- 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca makes social and fiscal legislation executable (see SDG1). Its technical architecture is designed to allow local governments to complete national regulations with their specific rules, empowering regions, cities, and communities to build and improve their own schemes toward inclusion while taking into account the existing laws in which they operate.\\r\\n\\tExamples: the cities of Paris and Brest use OpenFisca to deliver personalized information to residents on their entitlement to local benefits, including mobility and childcare support; Strasbourg used OpenFisca to design the reform of its school canteen scheme, enabling more pupils to access good food at a fair price.\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca can also enable public bodies whose budget is determined based on computable rules to calculate it autonomously and make it publicly auditable.\\r\\n\\tExamples: the French local government\'s budgets provided by the State are usually calculated in the second quarter of each year, while data to calculate their allotment is available at the beginning of the year, resulting in unnecessary delays for local decision-makers. The app \u201cDotations Locales\u201d enables cities and residents to calculate that budget earlier and plan accordingly: https://leximpact.an.fr/dotations.\\r\\n- 13: Climate Action\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca enables modeling any sort of legislation that contains a computational part. Carbon emission quotas could thus be modeled, improving their understandability and actionability. Just like with budgetary reforms (see SDG10), assessing the impact of climate-related legislation and ways to make it more effective would be significantly easier, cheaper, and more complete with the consolidated models that take into account interaction with other parts of law, like what OpenFisca delivers.\\r\\n\\tExamples: French benefits for improved housing insulation are made more discoverable to citizens, and the eligibility to the Australian Energy Saving Scheme is made discoverable at https://www.nabers.gov.au/rating-tools/our-calculators/nsw-esc-estimator, enabling a much stronger and faster uptake of this policy (context: https://www.codeforaustralia.org/case-studies/dpie-rules-as-code).\\r\\n- 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\\r\\n\\tIn most democratic countries, the executive branch has both abilities to propose legislation and is uniquely equipped to assess its impact through direct access to the administration, putting the legislative branch in a situation where it hardly has the resources to double-check effectively the impact assessments or to properly assess the impact of its own legislative proposals. The exact same asymmetry prevents many civil society proposals for reforms to reach democratic arenas. The models provided by OpenFisca enable lawmakers and NGOs to discuss and design potential reforms on an objective basis, at a very low cost, and with high accuracy, and to provide citizens with replicable, auditable assessments.\\r\\n\\tExamples: the French Parliament (Assembl\xe9e Nationale) provides all Members of Parliament with LexImpact, a tool designed for reform assessment; it also has a public instance enabling any citizen to design their own reforms: https://leximpact.an.fr; PolicyEngine enables reform design for both UK and US legislation: https://policyengine.org/.\\r\\n\\tSee also SDG11 for local institutions strengthening.\\r\\n- 17: Partnerships for the Goals\\r\\n\\tBeyond technical aspects, OpenFisca\u2019s specificity in the field of rules engine is its deeply collaborative nature. It is a digital common: both the core engine and the country models are created by a multitude of contributors. The rules and tooling that have progressively emerged to support such collaboration and its growth both enable and depend on active contributions by all actors: public administrations who are in charge of a specific aspect of legislation or regulation, researchers who can add historical depth to the data and analyze the resulting models, civil society who can audit and leverage the calculations; all of this in several countries, leading to a more robust shared core set of tools. This open-source, commons-based approach is enforced with reciprocity licenses and usage charters, and pushes all these actors to create new alliances and collaboration approaches based on shared goals that are embodied in a piece of software available to everyone.\\r\\n\\tSee https://oecd-opsi.org/publications/cracking-the-code/ and how OpenFisca\'s instant messaging system gathers a community of 300+ practitioners from all around the world, ranging from French administrations to American think tanks to Pakistani volunteers, all learning from each other and replicating experiments."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"AGPL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-doc/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/openfisca/country-template/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/openfisca/legislation-explorer/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france/blob/master/LICENSE.AGPL.txt"}],"protectionFromHarassment":{"facilitatesUserInteraction":"Yes","harassmentPolicy":"Contributor guidelines: https://openfisca.org/doc/contribute/guidelines.html"},"aliases":"","deploymentOrganisations":"","githubActivity":"","dpgLink":true},{"id":"10324","name":"OpenG2P","sectors":[],"stage":"DPG","privacy":[{"privacyCompliance":"OpenG2P components are flexible to be used within country specific privacy laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpenG2P instances are deployed in various jurisdictions and as such have to comply with local laws.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose. For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. In the context of OpenG2P, we consider \'stateless building blocks\' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII. Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: (a) Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. (b) Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. (c). If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together. The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Beneficiaries should be aware of and consent to how their data are used for a program\u2019s interaction with external systems. 2. Inbound and outbound data flow with external systems should be via secured authentication and transport mechanisms. Such secured authentication and data transport should follow best practices in keeping with international norms and standards. Where network latency creates challenges for encrypted channels, data encryption alone may suffice as long as vulnerabilities are limited on the endpoints. 3. OpenG2P components individually and collectively obfuscate (e.g. encrypt) the data such that if it is hacked or taken out it is as good as unusable. 4.

In particular PCMT aims to achieve this by increasing the connectivity between health domains (e.g. clinical coding) and supply chain operations by allowing local product catalog contexts to be mapped to adjacent (e.g. public and private care and supply chains) and global (e.g. manufacturing, suppliers, shipping) contexts.  In our experience this work of mapping product catalog codings between contexts happens already, however the typical tools are spreadsheets and disconnected databases (e.g. regulatory or supplier).  PCMT aims to supplement the use of these disconnected datasets and associated people, and bring their workflow into a common tool and community of practice, where those stakeholders follow a workflow of data curation that fits changing health requirements (e.g. new diseases and their medicines) supply characteristics (availability, regulatory approval, lead times, cost). \\nAs evidence for the application of to both of these targets, PCMT is already in use as a backing technology to curate datasets for family planning, essential medicines, vaccines and other medical product catalogs, both in local and global operations teams."},"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"VillageReach","clearOwnershipURL":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt/-/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.md"}],"documentation":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt/-/wikis/home","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"Imports and exports into CSV or excel formats"},"openStandards":["FHIR","REST","JSON  Design w/ User"," understand ecosystem"," scale"," sustainability"," data driven"," open standards"," reuse and improve"," security"," collaborative"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["Name and email for admistrators"],"dataPrivacySecurity":" The product catalog system has PII on catalog administrators, however the catalog specifically discourages tying catalog entries to patients or procedures.

For actions that involve public discussion such as comments and proposals, a username, name and profile picture is included. User profiles only show these 3 data points (example: https://meta.decidim.org/profiles/txema/activity). Emails cannot be viewed by either other users or admins. Should an admin or user want to get in touch with another user, they would need to use the messaging feature. Any non-public fields, such as passwords and tokens are encrypted by default.

These are the rights to education (SDG4), food (SDG2), health (SDG3), housing (SDG6) and work and social assistance (SDG1, SDG8). These scores tell us how well countries are using their available resources to make sure their people can enjoy each of these rights to the maximum extent possible given that country\'s level of income. Countries with well-functioning governments and effective public sectors perform better, and countries with high levels of corruption or inequality generally perform worse (hence SDG10). Many of the SDG indicators also feed into the Rights Tracker scores. However, unlike the SDGs, our scores are benchmarked according to each country\'s level of resources. This avoids the income bias problem that is inherent in the SDGs. (i.e. higher income countries generally perform better on most SDG indicators).  This is very important as it has been documented (e.g. by the World Bank) that ESG investment strategies that use the SDGs (and simliar) as indicators of development, skew investment away from lower income countries towards higher income countries. Our award-winning methodology avoids this problem. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsing a different methodology, we also produce country scores for eight civil and political rights.

We care about inclusion, and that is why our solution is to create a modular story that can fit new audience struggles and examples. We will continue working to diversify the content and the excluded groups will be represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarget 17.6: Knowledge sharing and cooperation for access to science, technology, and innovation\\r\\nTarget 17.17: Encourage effective partnerships\\r\\nWe work collectively by summoning a co-creation committee composed of topic experts, psychologists, scriptwriters, and youth, as well as expert organizations and international organizations such as UNICEF. We encourage knowledge sharing by guiding the co-creation sessions focusing on each collaborator\'s skill set and know-how.

Principles for Digital Development\\r\\n\\r\\na. Design with the user: we create a youth committee to join our co-creation committee and to represent the voices of youth in our creations. We also go through 3 user tests before launching a pilot"," in this case"," we reached 144 user testers and 382 pilot participants.\\r\\n\\r\\nb. Understand the Existing Ecosystem: we had 11 interviews with experts on youth and online safety to understand the context (8 of them from Brazil). When including users"," we also understood how it affected them in particular within Brazil.\\r\\n\\r\\nc. Design for scale: our interventions can be scaled up to any community since they are hosted in mainstream chat platforms that allow expanding reach based on the penetration of cell phones. We are having conversations with telcos and the government to expand our reach through their networks and with additional funding for dissemination after pilot results.\\r\\n\\r\\nd. Build for sustainability: our journeys are created based on our Mental Health Map"," which allows us to expand the content to multiple new interventions"," ensuring that users and stakeholders involved with be sure to receive ongoing support if engaged with the solution.\\r\\n\\r\\ne. Be Data Driven: not only our interventions are evidence-guides"," but we also run thorough testing and pilots to ensure long-lasting impact. Within the interventions we build in indicators to help us understand the performance and acceptability of our target audience\\r\\n\\r\\nf. Use Open Data"," Open Content"," etc: for this project"," we have created 45 content documents"," as well as contributed with Open Data and collaborated with our tech partners for the development of Open Software. Our process also allows for Open Innovation partnering with multiple stakeholders.\\r\\n\\r\\ng. Reuse and Improve: being our first approach to Open Content"," we can say in this case we gave support to Weni"," our tech partners"," who have been building their Platform with the RapidPro Open community and have contributed with the Open component of the Power BI connector for the platform and dashboard creation.\\r\\n\\r\\nh. Address Privacy and Security: since 2020 we have been focused on working under the premise of Privacy by Design. We have a data protection expert lawyer"," and for this project"," we hired a local lawyer to update us on the latest LGPD implementation in Brazil. All our projects within Weni are anonymized"," we have a data management plan in place and updated simple privacy policies that all of our users accept before entering the experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\ni. Be Collaborative: Not only are we sharing part of our heart with the Open Community"," but also as one of our core values"," we leverage collective genius. We believe that the only way to create impact and keep innovating is by working together with different people"," with different backgrounds and skill sets. We also take time to teach to our co-creation committee"," what we do and how we do it to install capacities within our collaborators.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Agile Development\\r\\n\\r\\nTo manage our projects we use an agile approach by working in cross-functional squads"," as well as incorporating external partners and co-creation collaborators. We divide our work into 2-week sprints and use ClickUp to follow up on advancements giving visibility to the rest of the team. We have 3 instances for User testing"," which create the solutions"," we make them part of the process from the start and test quick prototypes with the scripts in all their versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Human-Centered Design Principles\\r\\na. Understand and Address the Core Problems: Besides desk research on the topic we are going to address"," we interview experts"," make focus groups and one on one interviews with our target audience"," and finish our work with a Behavioral Map that gives us context to start building the project. This process usually takes us around 3-4 months\\r\\n\\r\\nb. Be People-Centered: We don\'t build a solution if we don\'t interact with our target audience before. Also as we move forward with getting to know individualities"," we have created a modular way of developing interventions that allow us to personalize and keep on working on personalization for a long time. The vision we have is to be able to provide a bias-free experience where relatable examples help us connect with our audience quickly and get them engaged in the development of their skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nc. Use an Activity-Centered Systems Approach: our projects are complex and involve multiple stakeholders. We have created a system based on the activities to be developed to reach the launch of our solution: Learn Phase"," Create Phase"," Test Phase"," and Impact Phase. We also are data-driven and assess the impact of our solution by working with control groups that can allow us to understand complex elements of the solution with an evidence-based approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nd. Use Rapid Iterations of Prototyping and Testing: when we write the first script we make a quick prototype"," some of them have included in the past"," focus group meetings for a script reading to get feeling and thoughts before building the tech solution. We also use a bot-building tool that allows us to build a quick prototype and iterate as many times as needed with minimum effort.

We wrote the Community Conflict Resolution as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Community Leaders we are responsible for resolving conflicts that may happen within our community of contributors. This is a guideline on how to approach those unpleasant situations as quickly and effectively as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnforcement Ladder\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the Community Impact Guidelines, we have set 4 different levels of consequences available to enforce. Logically, it would be a ladder in which the continuous misbehavior will lead to a level 4 consequence. However, some behaviors may apply directly to a level 4 depending on the gravity of the violation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a guideline on what would be considered violations of the Code of Conduct and how these will be handled:\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 1 - Correction\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\\r\\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\\r\\nConsequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\\r\\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\\r\\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 2 - Warning\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of\\r\\nactions.\\r\\nConsequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\\r\\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\\r\\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This\\r\\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 3 - Temporary Ban\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including\\r\\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\\r\\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\\r\\ncommunication with the community for a specified period. No public or\\r\\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\\r\\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\\r\\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 4 - Permanent Ban\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\\r\\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\\r\\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\\r\\nConsequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReporting and Conflict resolution process\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 2 ways to receive reports:\\r\\n\\r\\n               a. External Reports: A person from our contributors\' community sends an email to\\r\\n               codeofconduct@talk2u.co \\r\\n               b. Internal Reports: A team member reports the incident via our private slack channel   \\r\\n               report-misconducts\\r\\n\\r\\nAll reports should include: \\r\\n\\r\\nA detailed description of what happened, where it happened, and when it happened\\r\\nAny evidence of the misconduct to be reported (screenshots, audio, images, etc). Anything that will allow Community Leaders to be quick and effective in the conflict resolution\\r\\nName of the rule breaker and, if you have it, contact information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo follow up on reports, we will create and maintain a Code of Conduct Violations Report (CoCVR) document where we will be compiling all the reports of Code of Conduct violations to help us detect recurrent misbehaviors in consequence enforcement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResolution Process\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 1 - We receive a misconduct report and assign who will be the community leader that will address the report.\\r\\n                    \\r\\nSTEP 2 - We open the CoCVR and we add the information to the spreadsheet. We do a brief analysis and in case we need more information we connect with the reporter and specify what else would be useful for the conflict resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 3 - We assess the rule breaker Community status, to do so we take 2 things into consideration:\\r\\n                    a. Amount of violations they have committed to date within our Community: we search for \\r\\n                    the rule breaker\'s name in the CoCVR\\r\\n                    b. The gravity of the violation: [ADD EXAMPLES OF EXTREME/SERIOUS VIOLATIONS]\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 4 - We send a response within 72hs of receiving the report to the reporter of the incident informing the next steps to be taken based on the assessment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 5 - We engage with the rule breaker to inform them that a report has been received and what has been our decision. This decision might include requesting for more information on their end to comprehend what happened, or it could directly be enforcing one of the levels of our enforcement ladder.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 6 - If it is still visible within our Community, we edit, remove or modify the interaction that created the conflict. We might decide to leave it visible and make a public comment regarding our approach toward that behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional Considerations:\\r\\n\\r\\nBi-monthly reports should be delivered to understand our community\'s overall behavior\\r\\nConflict resolution time tracking should be a must to assess if we are complying with our SLA\\r\\n\\r\\nResponsible Community Leaders\\r\\n\\r\\nBruna Gelangauskas\\r\\nLu Su\xe1rez Batt\xe1n\\r\\nNicol\xe1s Ferrario"},"locations":{"developmentCountries":["Brazil","Finland","Spain","Uruguay"],"deploymentCountries":["Brazil"]},"deploymentOrganisations":["United Nations International Children"],"otherDeploymentOrganisations":["General Public - Youth in Brazil"],"id":"10447","name":"Talk2U Hate Speech Project","aliases":["T2U"," Talk2U Online Hate Journey"," Talk2U Como Se Eu Fosse"],"categories":["Open Content"],"description":"Therapeutic chat conversations to develop socio-emotional skills that mitigate the impact of online hate specially targeted to victims and bystanders from 18 to 29 years old.","website":"https://talk2u.co/journeys/online-hate","repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://talk2u.co/open-content/online-hate"}],"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"CC-BY-4.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://talk2u.co/open-content/online-hate"},{"openLicense":"CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://talk2u.co/open-content/online-hate"},{"openLicense":"CC-BY-SA-4.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://talk2u.co/open-content/online-hate"}],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is NOT collected NOT stored and NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":[],"dataPrivacySecurity":""},"deploymentCountriesDepartments":"","awardsReceived":"","githubActivity":"","dpgLink":true},{"sectors":[],"stage":"DPG","privacy":[{"privacyCompliance":" Janssen is one of the most advanced federated identity platforms an organization can deploy to delegate control and decision-making to end-users.

As a leading implementation of both OpenID Connect, which has the most advanced user consent journey, and the User Managed Access Protocol (\\"UMA\\"), Janssen is one of the most advanced federated identity platforms an organization can deploy to delegate control and decision-making to end-users. Janssen defaults to privacy-protecting configuration on deployment. For example, while many OpenID providers release the email and profile scopes by default, out-of-the-box, Janssen only releases the openid scope, which contains just a pairwise (i.e. consistent non-correlatable) identifier. A platform cannot maintain privacy without security. Janssen uses several commercial scanning techniques and other best practices to monitor the security of its code. Janssen is also used by Sensedia in the banking sector in Brazil and is one of the few open-sauce platforms that has passed certifications for the OpenID Financial Grade OpenID Provider, including the Financial Grade Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) test suite. Using the user-based consent flows, organizations that deploy Janssen can offer end-users a level of unparalleled transparency. For more information about UMA, see the Kantara specification at https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0.html Another important aspect of privacy design is to give organizations the ability to meet diverse requirements, which change based on the country in which they do business. To accomplish this, Janssen has standard extension interfaces, called interception scripts, which enable organizations to implement special business logic, such as audit logs or compliance reports.

This means that people or organizations who aim to propose antipoverty policies can quantify the impacts of their policy recommendations, and compare them against other policies to refine their proposals to maximize their impact. PolicyEngine also allows users to see how policies would affect deep poverty, defined as having income below half of the regular poverty line in a country. The app has seen usage across the political spectrum, but PolicyEngine is nonpartisan and targets a wide user base.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the Green Party of England and Wales used PolicyEngine to estimate how their manifesto would affect poverty rates in their report entitled \'Poverty Buster: The impact of the 2019 Green Party manifesto on household incomes and equality\'. Available at https://martin-farley.medium.com/poverty-buster-the-impact-of-the-2019-green-party-manifesto-on-household-incomes-and-equality-9663c39b783b.\\r\\n\\r\\nSDG5: Gender Equity\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicyEngine promotes gender equity by enabling users to analyze the gender-specific impacts of various tax and benefit policies in its open-source microsimulation models and the change in gender-specific poverty rates on the web app. By providing detailed breakdowns of policy effects on different gender groups, PolicyEngine allows policymakers, researchers, and organizations to design and advocate for policies that promote gender equality and address existing disparities. This empowers users to create more equitable policies, helping to bridge the gender gap in income and economic opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicyEngine supports the creation of decent work and economic growth by facilitating the analysis of policies relating to how taxation and welfare interact with households\' labor choices. Marginal tax rates and issues like \'welfare cliffs\' (where an individual suddenly loses entitlement to financial support with a small increase in income) are often missing from policy analyses, but PolicyEngine enables anyone to see how marginal tax rates and welfare cliffs would be affected by different policy reforms, both at the societal level and the household level.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the Centre for Policy Studies used PolicyEngine to model the impacts of a tax cut on labor income, which was taken up by the government and passed into law in 2022. Their full report is available at https://cps.org.uk/research/national-insurance-a-plan-to-blunt-the-pain/.\\r\\n\\r\\nSDG10: Reduced inequalities\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicyEngine enables reducing inequalities by providing users with tools to model and analyze the distributional effects of tax and benefit policies. Users can examine the impacts of policies on income distribution, poverty rates, and inequality measures like the Gini coefficient or the share of income held by the top 10 and 1 percent. This enables policymakers and organizations to design and advocate for policies that reduce disparities within country populations. By providing a comprehensive, data-driven platform for policy analysis, PolicyEngine helps users create targeted policy interventions that can reduce income inequality and promote social, economic, and political inclusion for all.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"AGPL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-app/blob/master/LICENCE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-core/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-api/blob/master/LICENSE"}],"locations":{"developmentCountries":["United Kingdom","United States of America"],"deploymentCountries":["Canada","Nigeria","United Kingdom","United States of America"]},"otherDeploymentOrganisations":["Organisations which have used PolicyEngine to conduct policy analysis include: (UK) the Center for Policy Studies"," King\'s College London"," the Green Party of England and Wales*"," the UBI Center"," the Social Market Foundation"," UBI Labs Network"," Centre Think Tank"," (US) the Centre for Growth and Opportunity"," Gary Community Ventures"," Fund for Guaranteed Income"," the Maryland Child Alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicyEngine is also used by individuals via the PolicyEngine web app"," which has an average of 1","600 weekly active users and 4","300 monthly active users.\\r\\n\\r\\n* PolicyEngine has seen usage across the political spectrum but its modelling is nonpartisan and the organisation is politically neutral."],"documentation":"Each country\'s microsimulation model has its own documentation website detailing how it models that country\'s taxes and benefits:\\r\\n\\r\\nUK: https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-uk,\\r\\nUS: https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us,\\r\\nCore microsimulation framework: https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-core,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PolicyEngine GitHub organization and repos also have documentation:\\r\\nhttps://github.com/policyengine","aliases":"","deploymentOrganisations":"","deploymentCountriesDepartments":"","awardsReceived":"","githubActivity":"","dpgLink":true},{"id":"10497","name":"Kolibri","sectors":[],"stage":"DPG","privacy":[{"privacyCompliance":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kolibri Learning Platform does not collect any email addresses and includes warnings for installation administrators, advising them of their role as data handlers.

For example, in Burkina Faso, Ticanalyse (http://www.ticanalyse.org) is using Somleng to provide CPaaS connectivity to local organizations and businesses. Ticanalyse can then directly generate new income streams by providing these services, creating jobs and creating economic growth in developing countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomleng also includes telco-as-a-service (TaaS) functionality out of the box. This is being used by telcos to provide their customers with CPaaS services. For example, in Mexico, Somleng is powering C3ntro Telecom\'s CPaaS (https://www.somleng.org/case_studies.html#powering-cpaas-mexico). This allows C3ntro to directly compete with global big-tech giants (e.g. Twilio), by offering a localized product. This in-turn keeps revenues in country, contributing to economic growth and decent work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"MIT","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/somleng/somleng/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt\\r\\nhttps://github.com/somleng/somleng-switch/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Chatterbox Solutions","clearOwnershipURL":"https://www.somleng.org/"}],"documentation":"https://www.somleng.org/docs.html","openStandards":["JSONAPI\\r\\nJWT (RFC 7519)\\r\\nTLS 1.3 (RFC 8446)\\r\\nTOTP (RFC6238)\\r\\n\\r\\nJSONAPI - https://www.somleng.org/docs/carrier_api/#create-an-account\\r\\nJWT (RFC 7519) - https://www.somleng.org/docs/carrier_api/#webhooks\\r\\nTLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) - https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=somleng.org\\r\\nTOTP (RFC6238) - https://github.com/somleng/somleng/blob/develop/spec/system/dashboard/authentication_spec.rb#L4\\r\\n\\r\\nJWT - Somleng\'s Carrier Webhooks are signed using JWT (RFC 7519).

One of the major reasons for this is the lack of access to high-quality vaccines. Vaccine supply chains have a lot of existing issues such as cold-chain failures, expired products, and counterfeit products, and these failures have enormous costs associated with them. The platform ensures that the original product manufactured by the Manufacturer reaches the end beneficiary by identifying each unit as a unique digital ID and storing this information in a database so as to avoid any duplication.\\r\\n \\r\\nVaccine supply chains are complex and fragmented. Our goal is to innovate the supply chains, especially the Vaccine supply chain to have complete visibility and transparency across the various stakeholders, thus our platform VaccineLedger ensures all stakeholders have complete visibility of all vaccines and other life sciences products at different stages, using blockchain, and also predict and prevent failures in supply chains.\\r\\n \\r\\nVaccine delivery becomes more expensive due to wastage of vaccines, nearly 50%-60% of vaccines lose their efficacy because of cold-chain failures, however, supply-chain failures account for nearly 80% of the costs of the vaccines.  VaccineLedger keeps track of all the batches and their expiry dates in order to prevent any usage of expired or counterfeit products, thus ensuring that the beneficiary receives certified products. And if these losses are not prevented, then it becomes even more difficult to vaccinate people quickly and efficiently.

Accessible and inclusive education: FOSS (Free Open Source Software) provides free access to high-quality educational resources, tools, and platforms, ensuring that students from all backgrounds can access educational materials and opportunities. This helps bridge the digital divide and promote inclusivity in education. \\r\\n2. Cost-effective solutions: FOSS is often free or available at a low cost, which reduces the financial burden on educational institutions. This allows schools to allocate their resources more effectively and reach a larger number of students, especially in resource-constrained settings. \\r\\n3. Collaborative learning: FOSS encourages collaboration and knowledge-sharing among students, teachers, and educational institutions. It enables the creation of online communities where educators can share resources, exchange ideas, and collaborate on the development of educational content. This fosters a culture of collaborative learning and innovation. \\r\\n4. Customization and adaptability: FOSS software can be customized and adapted to suit the specific needs and context of different schools and educational systems. This flexibility allows teachers to tailor educational content and platforms to meet the diverse learning styles, interests, and capabilities of students, enhancing the quality and relevance of education. In FUSS we adapted the distribution for schools that need specific software e.g. music schools or certain technical schools.\\r\\n5. Digital literacy and innovation: FOSS software offers opportunities for students to develop digital literacy skills and encourages them to become active creators rather than just technology tourists. By engaging with FOSS projects, students can gain practical experience in coding, software development, and problem-solving. This nurtures their creativity, critical thinking, and innovation, aligning with SDG9\'s focus on industry and infrastructure development. \\r\\n6. Support for open educational resources (OER): FOSS software facilitates the creation, sharing, and use of open educational resources (OER). OER are freely accessible and adaptable learning materials that can be shared and reused, allowing educators to access a wide range of high-quality teaching resources. This promotes the use of up-to-date, relevant, and localized educational content, fostering the delivery of quality education. \\r\\n\\r\\n [SDG 9] FOSS in schools can play a significant role in fulfilling SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). Here are some ways in which the FUSS Project and FOSS, in general, can contribute: \\r\\n1. Cost-effectiveness and accessibility: FOSS software is typically available for free or at low costs, eliminating the need for expensive licenses or ongoing fees. This allows e.g. start-ups that want to work with schools with a FOSS-based business model, to cut initial costs while providing development and maintenance services for schools. This is what happened and happens with Project FUSS where its technological partners helped the project flourish keeping it up-to-date with free modern technologies. One of our technological partners was a student in one of our schools who helped develop the FUSS distribution voluntarily almost daily. \\r\\n2. Innovation and collaboration: FOSS software encourages collaboration among companies, as it allows users to access, modify, distribute, and exchange the source code freely. In schools, this fosters creativity and innovation by enabling students to experiment, customize, and develop their coding and programming skills which can be spent during compulsory internships in IT companies or public institutions. Through such collaborative practices, FOSS software promotes industry innovation, laying the foundation for future technological advancements. \\r\\n3. Skill development: By embracing FOSS software, schools can provide students with hands-on experience and practical knowledge of coding, programming, and software development. These skills are highly sought after in the job market and can empower students to pursue careers in industries related to technology and innovation, contributing to the overall growth of the economy. \\r\\n4. Infrastructure development: FOSS software often requires lower hardware specifications compared to proprietary alternatives, making it more adaptable to different types of infrastructure and devices. This flexibility allows schools to optimize their existing infrastructure and extend the lifespan of their hardware, reducing the need for constant upgrades or replacements. Consequently, FOSS software supports the development and maintenance of sustainable and resilient infrastructure. For years our schools have been using refurbished hardware to save money, and natural resources, and contribute to a circular economy. \\r\\n5. Localized solutions: FOSS software provides the opportunity for schools and local communities to create and adapt technology solutions to address specific challenges. This empowers educators, students, and local developers to cater to their unique needs and find innovative solutions to problems related to education, infrastructure, or social development. By promoting localized innovation, FOSS software supports the achievement of SDG9 at a grassroots level.

These included healthcare workers and professionals as well as volunteers - this was launched on the Integrated Government Online training portal. This effort utilized Sunbird Obsrv to measure and generate metrics on the number of individuals being trained, the extent of their training completion as well as system performance. This was an instrumental effort in training several thousands of frontline workers in the fight against Covid. This measure was undertaken by the National Health Mission and was also part of the operational guidelines from the Ministry of Health.

Born as a response to the persistent problem of sexual harassment on the streets of Egypt, to which society had become increasingly tolerant. It was the first independent initiative to work on this issue and was launched in December 2010 by a founding group of four women together with tech partners, advisers, and volunteers. It generated mass public dialogue, pushed the National Council for Women and several members of parliament to draft new laws, inspired a first successful court case, and encouraged women\'s NGOs who had previously been reluctant to take on this issue, to form an 18 member NGO Task Force on Sexual Harassment. In an independent review (https://www.ushahidi.com/in-action/towards-a-safer-city) of Harassmap.org, they concluded that the Ushahidi map is an effective tool for data collection for sensitive issues, encouraging more participation and sometimes more truthful reports than other typical data collection means. \\r\\n \\r\\nSDG6: Following the COVID pandemic, there was increased use of the Ushahidi platform globally by organizations and individuals self-organizing to provide mutual aid, document COVID-19 testing experiences, and create visibility on where to access essential resources for vulnerable communities. Ushahidi supported over 2000 deployments in over 140 countries. One such engagement was Humanitarian Open Street Maps (HOT) in Indonesia which set up a deployment to track and publicize handwashing stations across Indonesia to allow easier access for residents. The idea was inspired by early expert advice deeming handwashing as an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. \\r\\n \\r\\nSDG13: Ushahidi was one of four organizations to win a Global Adaptation Index (GAIN) Prize in its inaugural year for its adaptation to urbanization, population growth, climate change, and other global challenges (https://www.ushahidi.com/about/blog/ushahidi-wins-global-adaptation-index-prize). One such climate change deployment is the Hatfield Climate Resilience-MVP Plan which crowdsourced information about Hatfield and its climate resilience (https://mvp.ushahidi.io/views/map). A second example is the Tana River Climate Change & Livelihoods Restoration Project (https://tclirp.ushahidi.io/views/map) by World Vision Kenya which aimed to contribute to enabling environmental policy implementation, governance, and environmental management through evidence generation using crowd geo-tagging. Case study report: https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/resources/climate-change-adaptation-and-livelihood-restoration-in-tana-river-delta/?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=WVK\\r\\n \\r\\nSDG 16: On good governance, Ushahidi was born out of an electoral crisis in Kenya. Ushahidi in practice can be read in the published paper titled \u201cCrowdsourcing Accountability in a Nigerian Election\u201d in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics by Catie Snow Bailard & Steven Livingston, proving that the use of Ushahidi \u2013 ReclaimNaija (http://www.reclaimnaija.net/)- increased voter turnout in the 2011 Nigerian election by 8%). Additionally,  Ushahidi has been used to monitor elections in India, Zambia, Mozambique, Nigeria, the USA, and many other countries over the past decade. Our strategy has evolved from primarily reactionary to proactively engaging with ordinary citizens and stakeholders to help foster transparency and accountability in elections.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations (UN) has a long history of working to maintain peace and security around the world. It strives to improve relations among nations and protect human rights. A second use case of SDG 16 is The UN Department of Field Services which used the Ushahidi platform for its peacekeeping operations. Called SAGE\u2014Situational Awareness Geospatial Enterprise\u2014the UN used the Ushahidi platform to collect, process and disseminate information from their field staff so the mission HQ has a better understanding of what\u2019s happening on the ground, can triage accordingly, and can make better decisions."},"documentation":"https://docs.ushahidi.com/platform-developer-documentation/","openStandards":["Security & Authentication: HTTPS"," SSL"," OAuth 2.0\\r\\nWeb standards: HTML"," CSS"," JavaScript","\\r\\nAPIs: RESTful APIs"," OpenAPI","\\r\\nData formats: JSON"," CSV"," GeoJSON","\\r\\nOpen source components: OpenStreetMap (OSM) -\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Ushahidi-inc/ushahidi-swagger/3.0-oas3 ","\\r\\nhttps://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24695099/2s8YszQWLi\\r\\n\\r\\n"],"bestPractices":["PSR"," TDD"," CI/CD"," CQRS"," Rest"," Open Source Tips -\\r\\nhttps://docs.ushahidi.com/platform-developer-documentation/development-and-code/coding-standards\\r\\n"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["Email address"," Location"," Telephone number"],"dataPrivacySecurity":" The Ushahidi Platform offers settings to protect some of these information items, without completely hiding them, by making them fuzzier.
