On the portal \u201cAccessible Kazakhstan\u201d one can find checklists with criteria for assessing accessibility of facilities, so that, if desired, the owners can read them and afterwards be involved in monitoring independently. Upon request, the project team develops recommendations, on the basis of which owners and government agencies start working on the adaptation of particular facilities for the aforementioned categories of citizens. Based on current data on accessibility of public facilities, comprehensive policies and plans for inclusion can be adopted and implemented. This, in turn, will reduce inequalities and accelerate achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals that affect development of an inclusive society. The world community needs qualified specialists who are able to form a barrier-free environment. It is for the purpose of training such specialists in 2019 within the framework of the \u201cAccessible Kazakhstan\u201d project that a unique online course \u201cEnsuring accessibility of a public facility\u201d was developed.

In CHT apps that support messaging with patients, the relevant patients are enrolled and consented into the process by a trained health worker. To our knowledge there have not been any deployments of CHT apps in which minors were enrolled in use of the system. One of the four core principles of the CHT community is that we are committed to designing CHT systems in a human-centered manner. In our view, this is not merely a buzzword or a statement of ethical priorities. Rather, it is a set of rigorous methods that work within a flexible yet disciplined process to prioritize people\u2019s needs and concrete experiences in the design of digital systems. An essential feature of human-centered design is that it prioritizes the dignity and agency of end users. It is also explicitly iterative and takes responsibility for making adaptations to address any potential unintended effects of a system - such as a situation in which health workers might experience grief or abuse from a peer or supervisor via their digital tool. We have conducted extensive research and members of our team are considered global authorities on the topic of human-centered design for global health, we consider this approach to be a thorough and substantive means of addressing lived experiences of harassment and abuse in health systems.

Specifically DiCRA contributes to SDG target 2.4 which states \'By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality. ,&#013; &#010;The objective of the DiCRA platform is to provide free and open access to geospatial datasets through an open digital platform thereby enabling concrete evidence-driven policies and concerted action from all stakeholders involved in sustainable and climate resilient agriculture. Through geospatial analysis and data powered positive deviance approaches, the platform informs stakeholders on which farms are more resilient to extreme weather events. Indigenous knowledge is tapped through field validation and ethnography to suggest good practices on climate resilient farming that are already working well through bottom-up approaches, to feed into large scale agriculture programs and policies and optimize public investments on climate resilient agriculture.  DiCRA platform therefore contributes to SDG 13 \'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\'. With its objective to enhance climate adaptation measures through data-driven approaches as well as impact on policies for climate resilient agriculture, DiCRA platform contributes directly to SDG target 13.1 \'Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries\' and SDG target 13.2 to \'Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning\'."}],"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/undpindia/dicra,https://github.com/undpindia/data4policy"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"UNDP","clearOwnershipURL":"https://dicra.undp.org.in/about-project"}],"documentation":"https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/tree/main/docs/manuals,https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/tree/main/src,https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/tree/main/docs/infrastructure","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"The website allows the users to download in geospatial data formats any open data layer that is being visualized in the platform.

It is also used by the RBM Partnership to End Malaria for global coordination of the malaria response. Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank\u2019s classification.   ,&#013; &#010;3. Good Health and Well-being Evidence: Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various disease areas within the health sector, including but not limited to, for national and sub-national HIV, TB, and Malaria programs. Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems.

Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: \u201cZenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,\u201d John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. \u201cThis model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda\u2019s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis\u2019 approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. \u201cWe attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,\u201d said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some partners pull out, saying: \u2018Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.\u2019\u201d ,&#013; &#010;5. Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis\u2019 software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis\u2019 analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: \u201cIn public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.\u201d Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA),&#013; &#010;6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a \u201cvirtual control room\u201d, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an \u201cmAlert system\u201d, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique\u2019s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.,&#013; &#010;8. Decent Work and Economic Growth Evidence: Zenysis is working with the Jobs Creation Commission (JCC) to establish a Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform to help the government manage and monitor its job creation programs. The platform, supported by Big Win Philanthropy, brings together a number of data sources to generate insights for policymakers, employers, job seekers and employment agencies.  Excerpt from Big Win Philanthropy Article: During this meeting, the delegation also learned about Ethiopia\u2019s Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform, developed by Zenysis Technologies to facilitate evidence-based decision-making through aggregating employment data from different information systems. Now in its second phase of expansion, the platform aggregates more than 20 data sources including job creation reports, education data, and labor force and employment surveys to create a national employment database and verify the accuracy of reports received from a variety of sources.,&#013; &#010;17. Partnerships for the Goals Evidence: The integration of data across multiple once siloed systems supports the partnership and coordination of both domestic and international stakeholders in each Harmony deployment. For example, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria is the largest global platform for coordinated action towards a world free from malaria and since July 2019, Zenysis Technologies has been working with the RBM partnership to enhance data sharing, coordination and action in the fight against malaria. Zenysis has developed the Global Malaria Monitoring Dashboard to strengthen regional and global reporting requirements, integrate data from different systems, and improve data visualization and management tools. The dashboards integrate epidemiological, programmatic, financial, supply chain, and other data from more than 30 countries."},{"sdg":"SDG3: Good Health and Well-Being","relevance":"For ALL: Harmony currently serves as the open source, data integration and data analytics platform for governments in 8 low-, middle- and upper-middle income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0).

Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank\u2019s classification.   ,&#013; &#010;3. Good Health and Well-being Evidence: Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various disease areas within the health sector, including but not limited to, for national and sub-national HIV, TB, and Malaria programs. Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data has been integrated, it is being used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: \u201cZenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,\u201d John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. \u201cThis model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda\u2019s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis\u2019 approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. \u201cWe attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,\u201d said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some partners pull out, saying: \u2018Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.\u2019\u201d ,&#013; &#010;5. Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis\u2019 software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis\u2019 analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: \u201cIn public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.\u201d Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA),&#013; &#010;6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a \u201cvirtual control room\u201d, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an \u201cmAlert system\u201d, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique\u2019s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.,&#013; &#010;8. Decent Work and Economic Growth Evidence: Zenysis is working with the Jobs Creation Commission (JCC) to establish a Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform to help the government manage and monitor its job creation programs. The platform, supported by Big Win Philanthropy, brings together a number of data sources to generate insights for policymakers, employers, job seekers and employment agencies.  Excerpt from Big Win Philanthropy Article: During this meeting, the delegation also learned about Ethiopia\u2019s Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform, developed by Zenysis Technologies to facilitate evidence-based decision-making through aggregating employment data from different information systems. Now in its second phase of expansion, the platform aggregates more than 20 data sources including job creation reports, education data, and labor force and employment surveys to create a national employment database and verify the accuracy of reports received from a variety of sources.,&#013; &#010;17. Partnerships for the Goals Evidence: The integration of data across multiple once siloed systems supports the partnership and coordination of both domestic and international stakeholders in each Harmony deployment. For example, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria is the largest global platform for coordinated action towards a world free from malaria and since July 2019, Zenysis Technologies has been working with the RBM partnership to enhance data sharing, coordination and action in the fight against malaria. Zenysis has developed the Global Malaria Monitoring Dashboard to strengthen regional and global reporting requirements, integrate data from different systems, and improve data visualization and management tools. The dashboards integrate epidemiological, programmatic, financial, supply chain, and other data from more than 30 countries."}],"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Zenysis Technologies Inc.","clearOwnershipURL":"https://www.zenysis.com/#harmony"}],"documentation":"https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"Yes, Harmony use cases rely on integrating and then analyzing non-personally identifiable information.

Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \\n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees. Risk: Sustainability of the content and adaptability to updated curricula. Mitigation: As demonstrated in the video above, the Notesmaster platform has developed an online peer review system that allows all stakeholders to contribute to a sustainable multiplier effect, leading to growing number of digital resources. These digital lessons can be copied and reversioned, then submitted for peer review by the local community. \\n Risk: Impersonation of Teachers by students. Mitigation: The platform is designed in such away that persons impersonating teachers can do little harm. They are not able to achieve a position of influence over their peers through impersonation. The respective Ministries of Education have a roster of curriculum officers who regularly access the platform and respond to challenges or flag unruly language or behaviour.

Create user personas: was undertaken at inception point. The UI/UX designer in collaboration with the Oky team created profiles of the target audience. \\n2. Develop and validate user scenarios: test cases where written which cover main user journeys and scenarios. During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019"," the main user cases were tested by Oky\'s target users. \\n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars"," colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \\n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \\n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example"," in Indonesia"," encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \\n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal & invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. It\u2019s theory of change includes scaling. In addition"," Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \\n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition"," there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Oky\u2019s privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards"," open source. \\n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \\n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance"," both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI"," as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition"," to comply with W3C privacy standards"," the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also"," as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English"," Bahasa"," Mongolian and some more to be coming too)"," it has been built to comply with the internalization principles.

Typically this is with foundational ID systems (e.g. National ID) and health systems (e.g. DHIS2). This feature of interoperability is very important as the universal data set of birth and deaths can help ensure government services are inclusive.\\nNational ID: OpenCRVS can integrate with any National ID system in order to reliably validate the existence of NID numbers provided during civil registration applications as well as reduce the time spent on the application form itself by pulling data from the NID system and auto-populate form fields.\\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can be integrated with a National ID system in a number of ways, depending on system capabilities. Current use cases include:\\n- To validate the existence of a NID number\\n- To auto-populate the form with data from the NID field to minimise required effort from registration staff\\n- To create a National ID for a new registration when the event occurs.\\nHealth: Births and deaths often occur in health facilities and those that occur in the community can be dealt with by health staff at the community level. These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an \'in-progress\' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems. Although not currently a recognised standard, we hope that these extensions become de-facto standards over time as their implementation becomes more widespread. OpenCRVS has been developed together with the support of a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), comprising a wide variety of international experts in the domain of civil registration and vital statistics, which has the following responsibilities:\\n1. Provide strategic advice for the overall direction and positioning of the OpenCRVS product.\\n2. Help identify short, medium and long term priorities for OpenCRVS product development.\\n3. Share experiences and documentation of CRVS that can be used to inform the development of the product e.g. lessons learnt, requirements, and useful contacts.\\n4. Support OpenCRVS research and policy development activities through working group or individual contributions.\\n5. Support in the development of the sustainability model for OpenCRVS.\\n6. Conduct additional research that will support development of OpenCRVS.\\n7. Peer review technical, functional design standards and content to be used for the development of OpenCRVS.\\n8. Advise compliance with relevant existing standards, including introductions to other relevant network and standardization bodies.\\nMinutes of the TAG meetings can be found here:\\nhttps://www.opencrvs.org/about-us\\nThe UN guidelines for civil registration and vital statistics systems provide a very comprehensive basis to support governments to build, operate and maintain effective civil registration systems that prevent doing harm. These UN guidelines should be used in conjunction with any OpenCRVS implementation and can be found here: https://www.un.org/development/desa/capacity-development/tools/tool/principles-and-recommendations-for-a-vital-statistics-system-revision-3/\\nWe engage with the OpenCRVS community so that vulnerabilities and risks can be continuously monitored.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \\n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider \'stateless building blocks\' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \\n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \\n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \\n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \\n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \\n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens. Protecting privacy and securing data are key themes in the design of OpenG2P."},"openStandards":["w3c verifiable credentials and others under explorations especially around handling of PII Work in progress especially around compliance to open standards around handling and security of PII Principles for Digital Development; the Responsible Digital Payments Guidelines by the Better Than Cash Alliance"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored and distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["This is information that when used alone or with other relevant information can identify an individual or family of individuals:","foundational or functional IDs","collection of information related to geographic location"," race"," gender"," age"," that allows for a person to be uniquely identified","genomic typing and biometric information.","Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information - A subset of PII is data that is"," by its nature or use"," intended to be secret.

Beneficiaries should be aware of and consent to how their data are used for a program\u2019s interaction with external systems. \\n 2. Inbound and outbound data flow with external systems should be via secured authentication and transport mechanisms. Such secured authentication and data transport should follow best practices in keeping with international norms and standards. Where network latency creates challenges for encrypted channels, data encryption alone may suffice as long as vulnerabilities are limited on the endpoints. \\n 3. OpenG2P components individually and collectively obfuscate (e.g. encrypt) the data such that if it is hacked or taken out it is as good as unusable. \\n 4.

Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \\n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDK\u2019s IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \\n Ona\u2019s Preference for Beam: \\n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \\n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFi\u2019s ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \\n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"openStandards":["FHIR.

Total reported dengue cases reached 420,453 and deaths at 1,565 - a 78% increase in infections (235,994) and 33% increase in deaths (1,181) from 2018. With manual reporting, release of dengue data is delayed which hampers the health sector\u2019s ability to effectively deal with the threat. There was a need to move the emphasis from treatment to prevention. Project AEDES was then developed to improve public health response and address the challenge of getting real-time on the ground information on dengue. The application is envisioned to guide and help the general public, government officials, policymakers, and health workers understand the spread of dengue in their communities, locate at-risk areas for outbreaks and probable habitats of mosquitoes, and implement interventions."}],"categories":["Open Data","Open Content","Open AI Model"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/Cirrolytix/aedes_dpg"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Cirrolytix Research Services","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/Cirrolytix/aedes_dpg/blob/main/readme.md \\n https://www.earthobservations.org/geo_blog_obs.php?id=472"}],"documentation":"https://github.com/Cirrolytix/aedes_dpg,https://github.com/Cirrolytix/aedes_dpg/wiki","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"openStandards":["HTML5","CSS3","AJAX","JSON","HTTPS","GeoTIFF","SSL We run the Lighthouse tool from Chrome DevTools to test web accessibility performance of Project AEDES website: \\n https://github.com/Cirrolytix/aedes_dpg/blob/main/Lighthouse%20Chrome/AEDES%20Web%20Accessibility.pdf \\n https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/ We refer to the Principles for Digital Development and describe below how our work with AEDES have applied these principles:","1. Design with the User \\n With the general public"," LGUs"," policymakers"," and public health officials as intended target users of AEDES"," we developed the application on a user-friendly web interface for ease of accessibility. We have presented this to WHO Philippines and we have gotten feedback from a healthcare professional on how and what to improve in the application.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem \\n Dengue is already an existing public health problem not only in the Philippines and but also in many Asian and Latin American countries. As the product needs to be improved further"," we are working with other researchers and scoping for funding opportunities.","3. Design for Scale \\n We are now closely working with other researchers to further improve AEDES. We want to expand the functionalities of AEDES and incorporate a dengue risk index. We have used the MVC Framework (Model"," View"," Controller) which isolates application functionality into self-contained components. We also utilized the API from Sentinel Copernicus Satellites to  get satellite images with vast date ranges.","4. Build for Sustainability \\n Since the data captured is from global and public remote sensing service"," the application can continue gathering data. There is a plan to create a social enterprise around the dengue prediction service"," by incorporating other risk frameworks"," we can generalize the process and ensure that other indicators will also be integrated. The results and/or insights will be offered on a subscription basis.","5. Be Data Driven \\n Data"," as it moves along its value chain from creation to actionable insights"," underpins the overall workflow of AEDES. Also"," by leveraging the three main disciplines of analytics - Descriptive"," Predictive"," and Prescriptive"," AEDES facilitates a holistic approach to dengue prevention and control and empowers its intended users to make informed decisions.","6. Use Open Standards"," Open Data"," Open Source"," and Open Innovation \\n AEDES was built through an open innovation challenge by NASA"," we also advocate the use of Open Source technologies such as Python"," PHP for tools"," QGIS for geospatial analysis","  Sentinel Copernicus Satellites for data"," and government sources for weather and health-related data. AEDES prototype is also publicly hosted 24/7 for free. We welcome collaborators to improve and provide feedback to the AEDES implementation.","7. Reuse and Improve \\n AEDES at its core was developed by reusing prior work by other researchers. By combining three research papers related to using social listening"," stagnant water detection"," and dengue prediction we have developed the application. We are planning on using other research to integrate risk frameworks to improve the current workflow of AEDES.","8. Address Privacy & Security \\n We dont collect"," store"," or transfer any personal information. AEDES website also uses HTTPS (Positive SSL) for website security.","9. Be Collaborative \\n The team has expanded since winning the hackathon and have been closely working with dengue researchers and experts (Dr. Thaddeus Carvajal"," Wilson Chua"," and Dr. Michael Promentilla). We are also continuously exploring collaborative initiatives to work on improving the many aspects of the AEDES (i.e."," Prediction models"," Data Sources"," Remote Sensing methodologies)"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is NOT collected NOT stored and NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":[],"dataPrivacySecurity":""},"userContent":{"contentManagement":"Content is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","contentTypes":["Datasets"," and satellite images"," charts of statistical models"," hotspot maps."],"contentManagementPolicy":"Project AEDES relevant links: \\nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Use: \\n https://aedesproject.org/privacy \\n No other content shall be posted on the website other than the data.

RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \\n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication.

Users are empowered to safeguard & share their data with appropriate consent management mechanisms. No personal data is shared among collaborators and only with explicit consent of all participating individuals, a collaboration flow can be triggered.

It collects data in an open, transparent, and consented manner - stores it safely & securely - and shares it as per the data sharing laws of the country with the appropriate consent from users and in an anonymised manner. Some of the steps taken to ensure safety of minors are: Minors can login only with parental consent Consented data sharing for all users Profile controls to modify and manage data stored against user profile Two-Factor Authentication (OTP based) Users join a Group by accepting an invite. No one can add a user to a group without their consent. Users can exit discussion areas at any time. Minors need to provide parental consent for authorisation flows. Content publishing workflow is built with a review step to ensure safe content is made available to users Sunbird Lern has a microservices for reporting and flagging. But, typically adopters extend this to cater to specific needs of the users and processes within their context. Users who take part in interactions using the discussion forum enabled via Sunbird Lern will have the ability to flag/ downvote conversations that they deem offensive or abusive. Threads that are thus flagged by users may eventually be removed by the moderator. The Discussion Forum component of the Sunbird Lern building block is enabled using the NodeBB community platform, which also provides the ability for users to flag threads via the configurations that it provides. ,The Code of conduct may be defined by an adopter based on the workflows that they choose to configure.

Currently we live in a technological age where children and adolescents live a normality that consists of the use of technological tools. They get bored easily, the way in which information is presented to them is not very motivating and school is no longer the only means of access to education. There are different tools through which they can acquire knowledge, however the minimum has a pedagogical basis. Due to the aforementioned, we must innovate in the teaching-learning process. Currently there are new teaching methodologies, with a focus on active learning and the development of skills through play. One of these methodologies is gamification. Different authors define it as a process in which game mechanisms are used to attract people, promote learning and solve problems. The purpose is to motivate the player\'s behavior. Elements in the game such as points, avatars or levels, increase the psychological predisposition of the player to continue in it. This makes gamification an ally of education. Currently there are game developers who use platforms like Godot, however they do not have the pedagogical knowledge to add elements that help the user to consolidate their learning. That\'s why Pixframe Studios is developing a plugin for the Godot Engine: a tool to help new game developers and serious game teams create new games with the goal of aiding in the development of education. As mentioned before, Latin America is still trying to develop new tools to improve their educational field, nevertheless they don\'t have enough knowledge nor tools to achieve it. The plugin is open source so that the community in Latin America can access new ways of creating video games with a pedagogical basis. In this way, code is created, optimized and shared. Educational material can be shared in an innovative way and finally a stock of illustrative material is generated such as button icons, backgrounds for games, fonts and unique Godot Engine assets."}],"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Pixframe Studios","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot"}],"documentation":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot/blob/main/README.md,https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot/blob/main/How%20to%20use","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"openStandards":["GDScript basics standard","Open Source Initiative Open Standard Requirements https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/open-standards.html#requirements","https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html","https://opensource.org/licenses/category Use Open Standards","Open Source","Understand the Existing Ecosystem"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["TOWI may collect information from its SUBSCRIBERS"," through our Site"," of the following types:","- Personal Information such as: Full name"," date of birth"," age"," place of birth"," address"," telephone"," family data or references"," email"," occupation"," gender"," academic level"," university career"," work or professional experience"," interests"," country"," region or state.

By onboarding them, we provide them with a new channel of income. Some of them were unemployed before working with us. Also, our Rural Development Fund, supports local communities in areas other than environmental work. We aim to distribute micr0-loans and micro-grants from this fund to eligible planters working with Treejer. Microfinance and land ownership are key ways to eliminate poverty.,&#013; &#010;We support regenerative agriculture and some of our projects are part of agroforestry and provide sustainable food supply to families involved.,&#013; &#010;We\'re building technologies that promote the empowerment of women. This is mainly done by providing fair and equal access to remote job opportunities in places where women have less opportunities. We encourage rural ambassadors to invite more women as planters in their local communities.,&#013; &#010;By reducing stormwater runoff and soil erosion, trees and plants can aid communities with water quality issues. Trees help collect nutrients that might otherwise be washed away from the soil. Some of our communities plant the trees in strategic places for better management of rain water. Forests slow the flow of water by intercepting precipitation and by consuming water in the ground.,&#013; &#010;One of the most important features of Treejer protocol is providing bankless payments to unbanked individuals as they contribute to the environmental causes. We have a special focus on onboarding communities from global south and provide them with decent job opportunities as planters. All women and men receive equal pay for work of equal value. In addition, we work with contributors from various countries. Currently, most of our core contributors are immigrants.,&#013; &#010;By developing open-source technologies on public blockchains, we\'re building sustainable, resilient and transparent infrastructures specially for communities in least developed countries. Treejer\'s innovations has already added financial, technological and technical support to African, LatAm and Middle Eastern people.,&#013; &#010;Using some of the key features of web 3.0, Treejer empowers the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status. When working with local communities in the supply side, we do our best to minimize the cost for them.

UNBL contains several relevant layers associated with the SDG.  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for crops and flooded vegetation. Example: The Marine Priority Areas for Food Security layer identifies priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision and carbon storage.  Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03371-z  Example: the Crop Suitability Change layer shows general agricultural suitability considering rain-fed conditions and irrigation on currently irrigated areas.The dataset covers two time periods (2011-2040, 2071-2100), as well as changes in agricultural suitability over two periods (1981-2100, 2011-2100). Example layer in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL provides a number of layers related to water provision and essential watersheds.  Example: The Nature Map Realised Clean Water Provision layer consists of a globally normalized map (from 0 to 1) of pixels ranked for their relative importance in delivering clean water to downstream beneficiaries. Example: The City Water Map layer contains information on the water sources for 534 cities internationally.

Example layer in link below.,&#013; &#010;Mapping urban areas, and trends in urban development is relevant here. At 10m scale users can also start to identify large green spaces in urban areas and agricultural peripheries. UNBL provides a number of layers related to this.

It includes classifications for Built Areas. Example in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL provides a number of layers that relate to carbon sequestration and climate change scenarios. Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to nature-based solutions for climate change.  Example layer included in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas. UNBL draws protected area data directly from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).

Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to nature-based solutions for climate change.  Example layer included in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas.

Born as a response to the persistent problem of sexual harassment on the streets of Egypt, to which society had become increasingly tolerant. It was the first independent initiative to work on this issue and was launched in December 2010 by a founding group of four women together with tech partners, advisers, and volunteers. It generated mass public dialogue, pushed the National Council for Women and several members of parliament to draft new laws, inspired a first successful court case, and encouraged women\'s NGOs who had previously been reluctant to take on this issue, to form an 18 member NGO Task Force on Sexual Harassment. In an independent review (https://www.ushahidi.com/in-action/towards-a-safer-city) of Harassmap.org, they concluded that the Ushahidi map is an effective tool for data collection for sensitive issues, encouraging more participation and sometimes more truthful reports than other typical data collection means. The map is no longer active. ,&#013; &#010;Following the COVID pandemic, there was been an increased use of the Ushahidi platform globally by organizations and individuals self-organizing to provide mutual aid, document COVID-19 testing experiences, and create visibility on where to access essential resources for vulnerable communities. Ushahidi is supporting over 2000 deployments in over 140 countries and this number is growing. One such engagement was Humanitarian Open Street Maps (HOT) in Indonesia that set up a deployment to track and publicise handwashing stations across Indonesia to allow easier access for residents.

Actually, we use Azure not just to store the users\u2019 data but also to store our library of VR modules. Equipment-Related Risks \\n - Possible overheating of VR headsets: We strictly adopt headsets that have an accessible document for Declaration of Conformity, e.g., CE certification. Our Terms of Use also indicate clearly that we don\u2019t permit our clients to use non-CE-certified headsets. Also, our user instructions explicitly mention the maximum duration of allowable continuous operation on a VR headset with a single user/child which specifically addresses the overheating concern. Finally, we recommend to our clients a wide spectrum of alternatives, with regards to VR headsets, on which we test all our VR modules prior to product delivery. \\n- Hardware-Software compatibility: We should always make sure that the developed software is compatible with the processor of the headset in terms of computational efficiency. Otherwise, the content would be poorly rendered with noticeable flickering, which impacts the user experience remarkably and biases the results. Since we develop the curriculum in house, we recommend to the clients the headsets on which the curriculum is tested by our team. Moreover, to mitigate this risk, we provide our product on a wide variety of headsets, with a wide range of costs, mainly to give the client the flexibility of choice according to their budget and accepted experience quality. \\n\\nOperational Risks \\n- Potential dizziness effects on users: Our safety policy and user instructions strictly mentions that our system is not allowed to be used without a physically-existing supervisor. If the sessions are taking place on-premises so the specialist is the supervisor, and if the session is taking place at home, so the specialist is supervising remotely but a guardian is accompanying the child physically. This is mainly to remove the headset in case dizziness has been observed. Also, our user instructions explicitly mentions the maximum duration of allowable usage on a VR headset with a single user/child which addresses the dizziness concern. Finally, we only adopt VR headsets with explicit dizziness instructions for the users including Oculus, Pico, and Gear VR. \\n- Potential habituation if not enough scenarios are developed and used: Our product plan takes into consideration the development of an ever-growing library of modules that takes into account the diversity of interests, social scenarios, acceptable difficulty levels, and the age range. This minimizes the possibility of habituation. There are several system design decisions that have been taken to guarantee the privacy of the users and the security of their data. This includes but is not limited to data anonymization, classification, and encryption. We also define a specific access level and scope for each type of users.

Barriers to inclusion and participation are exacerbated by the lack of access to affordable, relevant assistive technology. According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in people with disabilities engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability. Digital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure \'no one is left behind\' in our increasingly digital world.

Understand the existing ecosystem. \\r\\n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape"," and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.","III. Design for scale. \\r\\n This is very important to us. To this end"," the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.","IV. Build of sustainability. \\r\\n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning"," funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service"," we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.","V. Be data driven. \\r\\n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations"," monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.","VI.

Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr"," the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.","VIII. Address privacy & security. \\r\\n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below).

Preventing Errors:\\n - \\nE-Heza\'s decision logic model and all aspects of clinical care are governed by a clinical review process that includes physicians, healthcare workers, and digital health specialists. This work is reviewed by the E-Heza Executive committee. \\n- Development work is open source and follows a peer review process in which all code is first reviewed by another developer before it is submitted to the QA process. \\n- E-Heza adheres to best practices  privacy and data security standards to ensure the protection of private patient information. \\n2. Learning from mistakes: \\n- TIP Global Health\'s Model is based on gathering feedback and acting on it. There is a regular process of understanding challenges and potential errors which may cause harm. (https://tipglobalhealth.org/our-model/) \\n- The feedback process is governed by the E-Heza Executive committee and overseen by the TIP Global Health Steering Committee. \\n3. Promoting a culture of safety through safe practices and safe systems. \\n - E-Heza\u2019s training model is built to encourage co-design and encourages the foundational feedback mechanisms in order to understand both errors of omission and errors of commission. TIP  Global Health takes the following steps to ensure the privacy and security of data collected: \\n- Healthcare workers sign and commit to a \u201cProtected Health Information Confidentiality Agreement\u201d and receive initial and ongoing training regarding privacy and security. \\n - Access to E-Heza\u2019s backend (where private data is held) is secured with role-based permission access and only site administrators with proper need are given access to private data. \\n- Transfer of data between E-Heza\u2019s front-end client and backend storage is through SSL-encrypted channels only and performed only with authenticated devices. \\n- E-Heza maintains an access log which tracks all access and both to backend accounts and front end data collection.
