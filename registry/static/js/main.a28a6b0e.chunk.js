Effective local government, which is able to provide local infrastructure and services, is key to inclusive development at the last mile, and enabling local governments to collect resources and deliver services in an efficient & transparent manner enhances their capacity to deliver the conditions for well-being, sustainability, and innovation. Our work also aligns with Target 9.c, leveraging local intermediaries to provide digitally-enabled access to services to populations that may otherwise have to rely on physical channels, or have difficulty accessing services at all.,&#013; &#010;At eGov, we see our work as fitting with the themes of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities - and SDG 17 - Partnerships for Development. SDG 11 - Some key targets that our work supports include: \u2022 Ensuring access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services \u2022 Enhancing capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management \u2022 Reducing the adverse environmental impacts of cities, including by paying special attention to municipal and other waste management \u2022 Developing effective, transparent, and accountable institutions at all levels,&#013; &#010;At eGov, we see our work as fitting with the themes of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities - and SDG 17 - Partnerships for Development. SDG 17 - To make cities work for citizens requires collaborative efforts that reach across every sector of economy and society. We place great emphasis on collaboration and co-creation because urban governance is an inherently complex problem. We think of the ecosystem in terms of three sectors: samaaj (society), sarkaar (government), and bazaar (market or industry).

It is also used by the RBM Partnership to End Malaria for global coordination of the malaria response. Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank\u2019s classification.   ,&#013; &#010;3. Good Health and Well-being Evidence: Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various disease areas within the health sector, including but not limited to, for national and sub-national HIV, TB, and Malaria programs. Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data has been integrated, it is being used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: \u201cZenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,\u201d John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. \u201cThis model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda\u2019s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis\u2019 approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. \u201cWe attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,\u201d said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some partners pull out, saying: \u2018Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.\u2019\u201d ,&#013; &#010;5. Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis\u2019 software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis\u2019 analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: \u201cIn public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.\u201d Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA),&#013; &#010;6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a \u201cvirtual control room\u201d, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an \u201cmAlert system\u201d, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique\u2019s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.,&#013; &#010;8. Decent Work and Economic Growth Evidence: Zenysis is working with the Jobs Creation Commission (JCC) to establish a Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform to help the government manage and monitor its job creation programs. The platform, supported by Big Win Philanthropy, brings together a number of data sources to generate insights for policymakers, employers, job seekers and employment agencies.  Excerpt from Big Win Philanthropy Article: During this meeting, the delegation also learned about Ethiopia\u2019s Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform, developed by Zenysis Technologies to facilitate evidence-based decision-making through aggregating employment data from different information systems. Now in its second phase of expansion, the platform aggregates more than 20 data sources including job creation reports, education data, and labor force and employment surveys to create a national employment database and verify the accuracy of reports received from a variety of sources.,&#013; &#010;17. Partnerships for the Goals Evidence: The integration of data across multiple once siloed systems supports the partnership and coordination of both domestic and international stakeholders in each Harmony deployment. For example, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria is the largest global platform for coordinated action towards a world free from malaria and since July 2019, Zenysis Technologies has been working with the RBM partnership to enhance data sharing, coordination and action in the fight against malaria. Zenysis has developed the Global Malaria Monitoring Dashboard to strengthen regional and global reporting requirements, integrate data from different systems, and improve data visualization and management tools. The dashboards integrate epidemiological, programmatic, financial, supply chain, and other data from more than 30 countries."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"AGPL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony/blob/master/LICENSE"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Zenysis Technologies Inc.","clearOwnershipURL":"https://www.zenysis.com/#harmony"}],"documentation":"Installation instructions and local development setup: https://github.com/Zenysis/Harmony","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"Yes, Harmony use cases rely on integrating and then analyzing non-personally identifiable information.

Typically this is with foundational ID systems (e.g. National ID) and health systems (e.g. DHIS2). This feature of interoperability is very important as the universal data set of birth and deaths can help ensure government services are inclusive.\\nNational ID: OpenCRVS can integrate with any National ID system in order to reliably validate the existence of NID numbers provided during civil registration applications as well as reduce the time spent on the application form itself by pulling data from the NID system and auto-populate form fields.\\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can be integrated with a National ID system in a number of ways, depending on system capabilities. Current use cases include:\\n- To validate the existence of a NID number\\n- To auto-populate the form with data from the NID field to minimise required effort from registration staff\\n- To create a National ID for a new registration when the event occurs.\\nHealth: Births and deaths often occur in health facilities and those that occur in the community can be dealt with by health staff at the community level. These actors already use digital health systems to conduct their work and much of the data required for birth/death notifications is already gathered. We know that health staff are busy and need to focus on life-saving activities rather than administrative ones. To address the opportunity that this data has for civil registration, OpenCRVS can integrate with existing health systems via a FHIR mediator (leveraging existing health standards) and can receive data from health systems for follow up within the OpenCRVS system.\\nUse Cases: OpenCRVS can integrate with an existing health system via its OpenHIE compliant and FHIR standard interoperability layer, OpenHIM. Current use cases include:\\n- To receive birth/death notification information from a health system\\n- To allow Registration Agents and Registrars to view this data as an \'in-progress\' application and complete it in OpenCRVS\\n- To see disaggregated data related to the notifications received from health systems https://documentation.opencrvs.org/opencrvs-core/docs/system_overview/interoperability Interoperability standards were not available at the start of the project, so the OpenCRVS project has taken existing open standards (HL7/FHIR) and extended them for the purposes of integration with civil registration systems. Although not currently a recognised standard, we hope that these extensions become de-facto standards over time as their implementation becomes more widespread. OpenCRVS has been developed together with the support of a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), comprising a wide variety of international experts in the domain of civil registration and vital statistics, which has the following responsibilities:\\n1. Provide strategic advice for the overall direction and positioning of the OpenCRVS product.\\n2. Help identify short, medium and long term priorities for OpenCRVS product development.\\n3. Share experiences and documentation of CRVS that can be used to inform the development of the product e.g. lessons learnt, requirements, and useful contacts.\\n4. Support OpenCRVS research and policy development activities through working group or individual contributions.\\n5. Support in the development of the sustainability model for OpenCRVS.\\n6. Conduct additional research that will support development of OpenCRVS.\\n7. Peer review technical, functional design standards and content to be used for the development of OpenCRVS.\\n8. Advise compliance with relevant existing standards, including introductions to other relevant network and standardization bodies.\\nMinutes of the TAG meetings can be found here:\\nhttps://www.opencrvs.org/about-us\\nThe UN guidelines for civil registration and vital statistics systems provide a very comprehensive basis to support governments to build, operate and maintain effective civil registration systems that prevent doing harm.

Actually, we use Azure not just to store the users\u2019 data but also to store our library of VR modules. Equipment-Related Risks \\n - Possible overheating of VR headsets: We strictly adopt headsets that have an accessible document for Declaration of Conformity, e.g., CE certification. Our Terms of Use also indicate clearly that we don\u2019t permit our clients to use non-CE-certified headsets. Also, our user instructions explicitly mention the maximum duration of allowable continuous operation on a VR headset with a single user/child which specifically addresses the overheating concern. Finally, we recommend to our clients a wide spectrum of alternatives, with regards to VR headsets, on which we test all our VR modules prior to product delivery. \\n- Hardware-Software compatibility: We should always make sure that the developed software is compatible with the processor of the headset in terms of computational efficiency. Otherwise, the content would be poorly rendered with noticeable flickering, which impacts the user experience remarkably and biases the results. Since we develop the curriculum in house, we recommend to the clients the headsets on which the curriculum is tested by our team. Moreover, to mitigate this risk, we provide our product on a wide variety of headsets, with a wide range of costs, mainly to give the client the flexibility of choice according to their budget and accepted experience quality. \\n\\nOperational Risks \\n- Potential dizziness effects on users: Our safety policy and user instructions strictly mentions that our system is not allowed to be used without a physically-existing supervisor. If the sessions are taking place on-premises so the specialist is the supervisor, and if the session is taking place at home, so the specialist is supervising remotely but a guardian is accompanying the child physically. This is mainly to remove the headset in case dizziness has been observed. Also, our user instructions explicitly mentions the maximum duration of allowable usage on a VR headset with a single user/child which addresses the dizziness concern. Finally, we only adopt VR headsets with explicit dizziness instructions for the users including Oculus, Pico, and Gear VR. \\n- Potential habituation if not enough scenarios are developed and used: Our product plan takes into consideration the development of an ever-growing library of modules that takes into account the diversity of interests, social scenarios, acceptable difficulty levels, and the age range. This minimizes the possibility of habituation. There are several system design decisions that have been taken to guarantee the privacy of the users and the security of their data. This includes but is not limited to data anonymization, classification, and encryption. We also define a specific access level and scope for each type of users.

One of the most common use cases of the resulting API is for government agencies and NGOs to deploy simulators enabling citizens to assess which benefits they are entitled to, allowing them to obtain the social support they should get but too often don\'t because of lack of information and actionability.\\r\\n\\tExamples: https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr (France), https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/rac-legal-eligibility/ (New Zealand), https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/lesmevesajudes/ (Spain), https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/campaign/savings-finder (Australia).\\r\\n\\tImpact assessment in France: https://blog.beta.gouv.fr/general/2019/11/18/mes-aides-metriques/; https://blog.beta.gouv.fr/dinsic/2017/05/03/mes-aides-datascience-public/.\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca also improves personal finance and budgeting ability, by enabling any service provider or assistant to compute personal financial obligations and entitlements and predict their evolution across potential life events.\\r\\n\\tExamples: https://pa-comp.firebaseapp.com/ ; https://www.benefitme.nz/ ; https://betagouv.github.io/mes-aides-changent/graphique/?source=/mes-aides-changent/static/celibataire_handicap.json\\r\\n- 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth\\r\\n\\tBy making social and fiscal legislation executable, OpenFisca empowers individuals and businesses to assess their best employment opportunities, by removing the guesswork in computing exact income after tax and total cost to the employer. It also eases the creation and expansion of businesses in full respect of the law, by clarifying how regulatory constraints apply specifically to a given context.\\r\\n\\tExamples: https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/community-gaming/community-gaming-regulation-check/ (context: https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/article/an-australian-first-nsw-translating-rules-as-code-to-make-compliance-easy) ; https://www.simucrea.fr.\\r\\n- 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure\\r\\n\\tBeyond all the examples listed in other points, that demonstrate how OpenFisca enables innovation and is the central part of an upcoming critical digital infrastructure, APIs based on OpenFisca can model many types of legislation, including niche ones, enabling lawmakers, regulators, and businesses to share a common view of their entitlements and duties and to discuss potential evolutions.\\r\\n\\tExamples: Mining taxes in France are modeled in https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france-fiscalite-miniere; the Australian Energy Saving Scheme is modeled in https://www.codeforaustralia.org/case-studies/dpie-rules-as-code, and its National Building Code is being prototyped in a similar fashion.\\r\\n- 10: Reduced Inequalities (within and between countries)\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca supports citizens in assessing their benefits, thus improving access to social safety nets designed for reducing inequalities (cf. SDG1).\\r\\n\\tBeyond that aspect, by consolidating historical legislative data and enabling large-scale, population-wide simulations, OpenFisca enables economists, researchers, NGOs, and lawmakers to assess the impact of existing schemes and potential reforms, improving the understanding of policies impact on inequality and accelerating the delivery of policies to reduce it effectively.\\r\\n\\tExamples: The French Institut des Politiques Publiques measured the impact of 5 years of consolidated fiscal reforms on wealth distribution, and was able to reach that level of precision thanks to OpenFisca: https://www.ipp.eu/en/publication/february-2020-budget-2020-what-effects-on-households/; https://budget.ipp.eu; https://policyengine.org/uk/blog/2023-01-12-from-idea-to-impact-scoring-a-policy-reform-on-the-new-policyengine-uk\\r\\n\\tWith growing OpenFisca adoption, cross-country comparison of implementations of similar policies becomes possible: with a simple mapping of the name of each policy in their respective OpenFisca model, researchers can run simulations over multiple years and populations and compare the results of each policy, enabling identification of the most effective ones.\\r\\n\\tAn upcoming European Union-funded Multi-Country Project also considers modeling international business rules and taxation, enabling identification and correction of policies that place an undue burden on individuals and businesses operating across countries.\\r\\n- 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca makes social and fiscal legislation executable (see SDG1). Its technical architecture is designed to allow local governments to complete national regulations with their specific rules, empowering regions, cities, and communities to build and improve their own schemes toward inclusion while taking into account the existing laws in which they operate.\\r\\n\\tExamples: the cities of Paris and Brest use OpenFisca to deliver personalized information to residents on their entitlement to local benefits, including mobility and childcare support; Strasbourg used OpenFisca to design the reform of its school canteen scheme, enabling more pupils to access good food at a fair price.\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca can also enable public bodies whose budget is determined based on computable rules to calculate it autonomously and make it publicly auditable.\\r\\n\\tExamples: the French local government\'s budgets provided by the State are usually calculated in the second quarter of each year, while data to calculate their allotment is available at the beginning of the year, resulting in unnecessary delays for local decision-makers. The app \u201cDotations Locales\u201d enables cities and residents to calculate that budget earlier and plan accordingly: https://leximpact.an.fr/dotations.\\r\\n- 13: Climate Action\\r\\n\\tOpenFisca enables modeling any sort of legislation that contains a computational part. Carbon emission quotas could thus be modeled, improving their understandability and actionability. Just like with budgetary reforms (see SDG10), assessing the impact of climate-related legislation and ways to make it more effective would be significantly easier, cheaper, and more complete with the consolidated models that take into account interaction with other parts of law, like what OpenFisca delivers.\\r\\n\\tExamples: French benefits for improved housing insulation are made more discoverable to citizens, and the eligibility to the Australian Energy Saving Scheme is made discoverable at https://www.nabers.gov.au/rating-tools/our-calculators/nsw-esc-estimator, enabling a much stronger and faster uptake of this policy (context: https://www.codeforaustralia.org/case-studies/dpie-rules-as-code).\\r\\n- 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\\r\\n\\tIn most democratic countries, the executive branch has both abilities to propose legislation and is uniquely equipped to assess its impact through direct access to the administration, putting the legislative branch in a situation where it hardly has the resources to double-check effectively the impact assessments or to properly assess the impact of its own legislative proposals. The exact same asymmetry prevents many civil society proposals for reforms to reach democratic arenas. The models provided by OpenFisca enable lawmakers and NGOs to discuss and design potential reforms on an objective basis, at a very low cost, and with high accuracy, and to provide citizens with replicable, auditable assessments.\\r\\n\\tExamples: the French Parliament (Assembl\xe9e Nationale) provides all Members of Parliament with LexImpact, a tool designed for reform assessment; it also has a public instance enabling any citizen to design their own reforms: https://leximpact.an.fr; PolicyEngine enables reform design for both UK and US legislation: https://policyengine.org/.\\r\\n\\tSee also SDG11 for local institutions strengthening.\\r\\n- 17: Partnerships for the Goals\\r\\n\\tBeyond technical aspects, OpenFisca\u2019s specificity in the field of rules engine is its deeply collaborative nature. It is a digital common: both the core engine and the country models are created by a multitude of contributors. The rules and tooling that have progressively emerged to support such collaboration and its growth both enable and depend on active contributions by all actors: public administrations who are in charge of a specific aspect of legislation or regulation, researchers who can add historical depth to the data and analyze the resulting models, civil society who can audit and leverage the calculations; all of this in several countries, leading to a more robust shared core set of tools. This open-source, commons-based approach is enforced with reciprocity licenses and usage charters, and pushes all these actors to create new alliances and collaboration approaches based on shared goals that are embodied in a piece of software available to everyone.\\r\\n\\tSee https://oecd-opsi.org/publications/cracking-the-code/ and how OpenFisca\'s instant messaging system gathers a community of 300+ practitioners from all around the world, ranging from French administrations to American think tanks to Pakistani volunteers, all learning from each other and replicating experiments."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"AGPL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-doc/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/openfisca/country-template/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/openfisca/legislation-explorer/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france/blob/master/LICENSE.AGPL.txt"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"OpenFisca Foundation","clearOwnershipURL":"OpenFisca Core has been incubated within the French state (https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/openfisca), shifting across ministries, for the last 10 years (see https://openfisca.org/en/about/).

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose. For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. In the context of OpenG2P, we consider \'stateless building blocks\' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII. Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: (a) Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. (b) Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. (c). If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together. The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens. Protecting privacy and securing data are key themes in the design of OpenG2P."},"openStandards":["w3c verifiable credentials and others under explorations especially around handling of PII Work in progress especially around compliance to open standards around handling and security of PII\\r\\n"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored and distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["This is information that when used alone or with other relevant information can identify an individual or family of individuals:","foundational or functional IDs"," collection of information related to geographic location"," race"," gender"," age"," that allows for a person to be uniquely identified.","Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information - A subset of PII is data that is"," by its nature or use"," intended to be secret.

OpenG2P components individually and collectively obfuscate (e.g. encrypt) the data such that if it is hacked or taken out it is as good as unusable. 4. An OpenG2P project should evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII. Preference is not storing data, making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors. 5. A project absolutely needing to store PII, e.g. Beneficiary Database should follow a minimum set of data-handling conventions and procedures. Limited Use - A key concept in our privacy approach is the requirement to only use information for the intended purpose and to prevent transmission of data to systems that are non-compliant with policies.

Both of these targets require more efficient health supply chains, and that\u2019s a primary goal of PCMT.   In particular PCMT aims to achieve this by increasing the connectivity between health domains (e.g. clinical coding) and supply chain operations by allowing local product catalog contexts to be mapped to adjacent (e.g. public and private care and supply chains) and global (e.g. manufacturing, suppliers, shipping) contexts.  In our experience this work of mapping product catalog codings between contexts happens already, however the typical tools are spreadsheets and disconnected databases (e.g. regulatory or supplier).  PCMT aims to supplement the use of these disconnected datasets and associated people, and bring their workflow into a common tool and community of practice, where those stakeholders follow a workflow of data curation that fits changing health requirements (e.g. new diseases and their medicines) supply characteristics (availability, regulatory approval, lead times, cost). \\nAs evidence for the application of to both of these targets, PCMT is already in use as a backing technology to curate datasets for family planning, essential medicines, vaccines and other medical product catalogs, both in local and global operations teams."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"NPOSL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt/-/blob/master/LICENSE"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"VillageReach","clearOwnershipURL":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt/-/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.md"}],"documentation":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt/-/wikis/home","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"Imports and exports into CSV or excel formats"},"openStandards":["FHIR","REST","JSON  Design w/ User"," understand ecosystem"," scale"," sustainability"," data driven"," open standards"," reuse and improve"," security"," collaborative"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["Name and email for admistrators"],"dataPrivacySecurity":" The product catalog system has PII on catalog administrators, however the catalog specifically discourages tying catalog entries to patients or procedures.

For actions that involve public discussion such as comments and proposals, a username, name and profile picture is included. User profiles only show these 3 data points (example: https://meta.decidim.org/profiles/txema/activity). Emails cannot be viewed by either other users or admins. Should an admin or user want to get in touch with another user, they would need to use the messaging feature. Any non-public fields, such as passwords and tokens are encrypted by default. In compliance with GDPR, Decidim offers a feature to download all your data and delete your account.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with our social contract, data integrity is very important to the legitimacy of participatory processes. Decidim is coded with a heavy reliance on action logging which ensure all changes done to participatory processes are traceable.

These are the rights to education (SDG4), food (SDG2), health (SDG3), housing (SDG6) and work and social assistance (SDG1, SDG8). These scores tell us how well countries are using their available resources to make sure their people can enjoy each of these rights to the maximum extent possible given that country\'s level of income. Countries with well-functioning governments and effective public sectors perform better, and countries with high levels of corruption or inequality generally perform worse (hence SDG10). Many of the SDG indicators also feed into the Rights Tracker scores. However, unlike the SDGs, our scores are benchmarked according to each country\'s level of resources. This avoids the income bias problem that is inherent in the SDGs. (i.e. higher income countries generally perform better on most SDG indicators).  This is very important as it has been documented (e.g. by the World Bank) that ESG investment strategies that use the SDGs (and simliar) as indicators of development, skew investment away from lower income countries towards higher income countries. Our award-winning methodology avoids this problem. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsing a different methodology, we also produce country scores for eight civil and political rights.

We wrote the Community Conflict Resolution as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Community Leaders we are responsible for resolving conflicts that may happen within our community of contributors. This is a guideline on how to approach those unpleasant situations as quickly and effectively as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnforcement Ladder\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the Community Impact Guidelines, we have set 4 different levels of consequences available to enforce. Logically, it would be a ladder in which the continuous misbehavior will lead to a level 4 consequence. However, some behaviors may apply directly to a level 4 depending on the gravity of the violation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a guideline on what would be considered violations of the Code of Conduct and how these will be handled:\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 1 - Correction\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\\r\\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\\r\\nConsequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\\r\\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\\r\\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 2 - Warning\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of\\r\\nactions.\\r\\nConsequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\\r\\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\\r\\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This\\r\\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 3 - Temporary Ban\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including\\r\\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\\r\\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\\r\\ncommunication with the community for a specified period. No public or\\r\\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\\r\\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\\r\\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 4 - Permanent Ban\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\\r\\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\\r\\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\\r\\nConsequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReporting and Conflict resolution process\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 2 ways to receive reports:\\r\\n\\r\\n               a. External Reports: A person from our contributors\' community sends an email to\\r\\n               codeofconduct@talk2u.co \\r\\n               b. Internal Reports: A team member reports the incident via our private slack channel   \\r\\n               report-misconducts\\r\\n\\r\\nAll reports should include: \\r\\n\\r\\nA detailed description of what happened, where it happened, and when it happened\\r\\nAny evidence of the misconduct to be reported (screenshots, audio, images, etc). Anything that will allow Community Leaders to be quick and effective in the conflict resolution\\r\\nName of the rule breaker and, if you have it, contact information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo follow up on reports, we will create and maintain a Code of Conduct Violations Report (CoCVR) document where we will be compiling all the reports of Code of Conduct violations to help us detect recurrent misbehaviors in consequence enforcement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResolution Process\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 1 - We receive a misconduct report and assign who will be the community leader that will address the report.\\r\\n                    \\r\\nSTEP 2 - We open the CoCVR and we add the information to the spreadsheet. We do a brief analysis and in case we need more information we connect with the reporter and specify what else would be useful for the conflict resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 3 - We assess the rule breaker Community status, to do so we take 2 things into consideration:\\r\\n                    a. Amount of violations they have committed to date within our Community: we search for \\r\\n                    the rule breaker\'s name in the CoCVR\\r\\n                    b. The gravity of the violation: [ADD EXAMPLES OF EXTREME/SERIOUS VIOLATIONS]\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 4 - We send a response within 72hs of receiving the report to the reporter of the incident informing the next steps to be taken based on the assessment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 5 - We engage with the rule breaker to inform them that a report has been received and what has been our decision. This decision might include requesting for more information on their end to comprehend what happened, or it could directly be enforcing one of the levels of our enforcement ladder.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 6 - If it is still visible within our Community, we edit, remove or modify the interaction that created the conflict. We might decide to leave it visible and make a public comment regarding our approach toward that behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional Considerations:\\r\\n\\r\\nBi-monthly reports should be delivered to understand our community\'s overall behavior\\r\\nConflict resolution time tracking should be a must to assess if we are complying with our SLA\\r\\n\\r\\nResponsible Community Leaders\\r\\n\\r\\nBruna Gelangauskas\\r\\nLu Su\xe1rez Batt\xe1n\\r\\nNicol\xe1s Ferrario"},"bestPractices":["Our co-creation process and experience development are inspired by:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Understand the Existing Ecosystem: we had 11 interviews with experts on youth and online safety to understand the context (8 of them from Brazil).

Design for scale: our interventions can be scaled up to any community since they are hosted in mainstream chat platforms that allow expanding reach based on the penetration of cell phones. We are having conversations with telcos and the government to expand our reach through their networks and with additional funding for dissemination after pilot results.\\r\\n\\r\\nd.

Be Collaborative: Not only are we sharing part of our heart with the Open Community"," but also as one of our core values"," we leverage collective genius. We believe that the only way to create impact and keep innovating is by working together with different people"," with different backgrounds and skill sets. We also take time to teach to our co-creation committee"," what we do and how we do it to install capacities within our collaborators.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Agile Development\\r\\n\\r\\nTo manage our projects we use an agile approach by working in cross-functional squads"," as well as incorporating external partners and co-creation collaborators.

We have created a system based on the activities to be developed to reach the launch of our solution: Learn Phase"," Create Phase"," Test Phase"," and Impact Phase. We also are data-driven and assess the impact of our solution by working with control groups that can allow us to understand complex elements of the solution with an evidence-based approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nd. Use Rapid Iterations of Prototyping and Testing: when we write the first script we make a quick prototype"," some of them have included in the past"," focus group meetings for a script reading to get feeling and thoughts before building the tech solution.

Janssen defaults to privacy-protecting configuration on deployment.","privacyComplianceURL":"Building a digital identity platform that enables organizations to preserve a person\'s privacy was embedded into the original Janssen design by providing systems that enable organizations to give users control of their data. As a leading implementation of both OpenID Connect, which has the most advanced user consent journey, and the User Managed Access Protocol (\\"UMA\\"), Janssen is one of the most advanced federated identity platforms an organization can deploy to delegate control and decision-making to end-users. Janssen defaults to privacy-protecting configuration on deployment. For example, while many OpenID providers release the email and profile scopes by default, out-of-the-box, Janssen only releases the openid scope, which contains just a pairwise (i.e. consistent non-correlatable) identifier. A platform cannot maintain privacy without security. Janssen uses several commercial scanning techniques and other best practices to monitor the security of its code. Janssen is also used by Sensedia in the banking sector in Brazil and is one of the few open-sauce platforms that has passed certifications for the OpenID Financial Grade OpenID Provider, including the Financial Grade Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) test suite. Using the user-based consent flows, organizations that deploy Janssen can offer end-users a level of unparalleled transparency. For more information about UMA, see the Kantara specification at https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0.html Another important aspect of privacy design is to give organizations the ability to meet diverse requirements, which change based on the country in which they do business. To accomplish this, Janssen has standard extension interfaces, called interception scripts, which enable organizations to implement special business logic, such as audit logs or compliance reports.

This means that people or organizations who aim to propose antipoverty policies can quantify the impacts of their policy recommendations, and compare them against other policies to refine their proposals to maximize their impact. PolicyEngine also allows users to see how policies would affect deep poverty, defined as having income below half of the regular poverty line in a country. The app has seen usage across the political spectrum, but PolicyEngine is nonpartisan and targets a wide user base.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the Green Party of England and Wales used PolicyEngine to estimate how their manifesto would affect poverty rates in their report entitled \'Poverty Buster: The impact of the 2019 Green Party manifesto on household incomes and equality\'. Available at https://martin-farley.medium.com/poverty-buster-the-impact-of-the-2019-green-party-manifesto-on-household-incomes-and-equality-9663c39b783b.\\r\\n\\r\\nSDG5: Gender Equity\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicyEngine promotes gender equity by enabling users to analyze the gender-specific impacts of various tax and benefit policies in its open-source microsimulation models and the change in gender-specific poverty rates on the web app. By providing detailed breakdowns of policy effects on different gender groups, PolicyEngine allows policymakers, researchers, and organizations to design and advocate for policies that promote gender equality and address existing disparities. This empowers users to create more equitable policies, helping to bridge the gender gap in income and economic opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicyEngine supports the creation of decent work and economic growth by facilitating the analysis of policies relating to how taxation and welfare interact with households\' labor choices. Marginal tax rates and issues like \'welfare cliffs\' (where an individual suddenly loses entitlement to financial support with a small increase in income) are often missing from policy analyses, but PolicyEngine enables anyone to see how marginal tax rates and welfare cliffs would be affected by different policy reforms, both at the societal level and the household level.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the Centre for Policy Studies used PolicyEngine to model the impacts of a tax cut on labor income, which was taken up by the government and passed into law in 2022. Their full report is available at https://cps.org.uk/research/national-insurance-a-plan-to-blunt-the-pain/.\\r\\n\\r\\nSDG10: Reduced inequalities\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicyEngine enables reducing inequalities by providing users with tools to model and analyze the distributional effects of tax and benefit policies. Users can examine the impacts of policies on income distribution, poverty rates, and inequality measures like the Gini coefficient or the share of income held by the top 10 and 1 percent. This enables policymakers and organizations to design and advocate for policies that reduce disparities within country populations. By providing a comprehensive, data-driven platform for policy analysis, PolicyEngine helps users create targeted policy interventions that can reduce income inequality and promote social, economic, and political inclusion for all.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"AGPL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-app/blob/master/LICENCE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-core/blob/master/LICENSE,\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-api/blob/master/LICENSE"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"PolicyEngine","clearOwnershipURL":"PolicyEngine\'s about page defines the team structure and oversight: https://policyengine.org/uk/about"}],"documentation":"Each country\'s microsimulation model has its own documentation website detailing how it models that country\'s taxes and benefits:\\r\\n\\r\\nUK: https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-uk,\\r\\nUS: https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us,\\r\\nCore microsimulation framework: https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-core,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PolicyEngine GitHub organization and repos also have documentation:\\r\\nhttps://github.com/policyengine","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"PolicyEngine handles both custom reform data generated by users (e.g. details of a reform that a user would like to analyse), and user-submitted data about their household (e.g. the number of people in it, and the taxes and benefits they\'d like to calculate).

This is reflected in the nearly 1 million websites using Drupal today: https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/drupal \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the enterprise scale as well, analysts like Gartner and Forrester see significant economic opportunities in the use of open-source software: https://www.forrester.com/blogs/what-open-sources-collision-with-paas-means-for-drupal-and-wordpress-services-forr-in-3-video/ \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also an ecosystem of more than a thousand Drupal agencies hiring Drupal talent in nearly every country in the world, and tens of thousands of end-users who need the same talent. Because Drupal is a widely adopted technology in both the private and public sectors, Drupal empowers those who learn it with more bargaining power and more opportunities for jobs in Open Source technology. Demand is high enough that the Drupal Association maintains jobs.drupal.org as a platform to connect talented Drupal developers to employment opportunities. \\r\\nhttps://www.drupal.org/drupal-services \\r\\nhttps://jobs.drupal.org\\r\\nhttps://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Drupal+Developer&l=&vjk=c4545e0824ca3195 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, communities all over the world have local associations that connect emerging Drupal talent with economic opportunities in their area: \\r\\nhttps://www.drupal.org/node/3069614 \\r\\n\\r\\n===========\\r\\n10: Reduced Inequalities\\r\\n===========\\r\\n\\r\\nTarget 10.1: Reduce income inequalities\\r\\nTarget 10.2: Promote universal social, economic, and political inclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen source software such as Drupal offers a counter-balance to traditional economic models that extract resources from developing nations rather than providing them with resources. An internet based on proprietary technology, patents, and trademarks replicates the wealth extraction of private industry and crowds out entrepreneurship. It puts wealth and value in only a few hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast Drupal and the open web focus on providing a free and open internet, where that economic opportunity is accessible to all. In particular, Drupal empowers low-income users around the globe in two key ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntrepreneurship - In the last two decades, entrepreneurs have built businesses based on Drupal all over the world, participating in an ecosystem of almost $4 billion of economic activity. Many of these entrepreneurs are from economically disadvantaged and underprivileged regions of the world. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence: Geographical Drupal groups: https://groups.drupal.org/og/all?keys=>_tid[]=141\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence: The Drupal Association just hosted a Young Africa Leaders Initiative fellow - https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-association-selected-to-host-denaya-dennis-a-young-african-leader \\r\\n\\r\\nSocial, economic, and political inclusion: The open web can be a powerful equalizer. In contrast to the increasingly proprietary platforms dominating web publishing, Drupal can be used in any way to promote a social message or political point of view. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence: Government and non-profit Drupal case studies from around the world: https://www.drupal.org/case-studies?sectors%5B%5D=24660\xa7ors%5B%5D=24496 \\r\\n\\r\\n===========\\r\\n17: Partnerships for the Goals\\r\\n===========\\r\\n\\r\\nTarget 17.6: Knowledge sharing and cooperation for access to science, technology, and innovation\\r\\nTarget 17.7: Promote sustainable technologies to developing countries\\r\\nTarget 17.8: Strengthen the science, technology, and innovation capacity of least-developed countries\\r\\nTarget 17.16: Enhance the global partnership for sustainable development\\r\\nTarget 17.17: Encourage effective partnerships\\r\\nTarget 17.18: Enhance the availability of reliable data\\r\\n\\r\\nDrupal\'s support of goal 17 is best exemplified by the next section, \\"Indirect Support\\", in which we discuss the hundreds or even thousands of mission-driven organizations and government agencies that have chosen Drupal to advance their goals and the SDGs. \\r\\n\\r\\nDrupal is often the hub of the digital presence of all of these organizations- allowing them to promote, monitor, and report on their progress in advancing the SDGs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations itself uses Drupal to publish, promote, and coordinate the SDGs- helping to grow the international partnership: \\r\\nhttps://sdgs.un.org/topics/technology\\r\\nhttps://sdgs.un.org/topics/multi-stakeholder-partnerships-and-voluntary-commitments\\r\\nhttps://partnershipaccelerator.netlify.app/\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence: Government and non-profit Drupal case studies from around the world: https://www.drupal.org/case-studies?sectors%5B%5D=24660\xa7ors%5B%5D=24496 \\r\\n(See specific case studies below)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n======================\\r\\nIndirect support: \\r\\nAnd evidence for 17: Partnerships for the Goals\\r\\n======================\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are hundreds of organizations using Drupal to further their missions and advance the SDGs.

The platform ensures that the original product manufactured by the Manufacturer reaches the end beneficiary by identifying each unit as a unique digital ID and storing this information in a database so as to avoid any duplication.\\r\\n \\r\\nVaccine supply chains are complex and fragmented.

VaccineLedger keeps track of all the batches and their expiry dates in order to prevent any usage of expired or counterfeit products, thus ensuring that the beneficiary receives certified products.

Women from low socioeconomic backgrounds are often at higher risk of GBV. By providing free access to services for these and all women, we are strengthening their social and economic empowerment, which will reduce their vulnerability to GBV. Safe YOU is also a platform that allows stakeholders access to case management tools and a data analysis system designed to collect non-personally identifiable data (non-PII) and provide evidence-based policy recommendations. This helps to solve the global issue of a data gap and will lead to long-term prevention of future cases of GBV. Therefore, our solution is intended to reach most of the targets set out by SDG 5, \u201cGender Equality\u201d (targets: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5a, 5b, 5c)."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"AGPL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/safeyou-space/safeyou/blob/main/LICENSE"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Impact Innovations Institute LLC","clearOwnershipURL":"The ownership of Safe YOU solution, all its components and all the source code is certified through the employment and service contracts signed with the development teams, and UI/UX teams, which clearly state that all intellectual property rights connected to Safe YOU solution belong to Impact Innovations Institute.

These contacts may be anyone from user\'s phone\'s contacts list, NGOs or state authorities that are included in our Apps \'Network\' section, as well as the Police, if the \'Contact Police\' function is enabled by the user. Since the usage of the mobile App may itself become a problem for already vulnerable groups, we have created two advanced security layers to minimize the risk of abusers discovering the app: a Dual PIN and a camouflage icon setting. The Dual PIN acts as a safety measure, allowing users to create a real PIN to access the app and a fake PIN that displays a photo gallery. The camouflage setting hides the app icon by displaying it as an image editing app so that women can use the app without fear of reprisal. The content in Forums is generated through our organization\'s content creators and by the personnel of governmental and non-governmental organizations who are partnering with us and have access to the tools of content generation and management. Contributors of the Forums section are thoroughly chosen to make sure that they adhere to the general principle of \u201cDo no harm\u201d, while they create content and/or consult adolescent girls and women. Our Partner organizations are responsible to make sure that their engaged personnel acts appropriately, e.g.: - Avoids questions, attitudes, or comments that are judgmental or insensitive to cultural values or status; - Does not use language, make suggestions, provide misleading information or offer advice, which is inappropriate, offensive, or abusive. In the Forums, users engage with each other in discussions and can ask questions to our partner organizations or to verified consultants, who are identifiable in the forums by a \u201cverified badge\u201d. That is why we clearly define in our \\"Terms and Conditions\\" and relevant policies that the users should refrain from abusing, threatening or otherwise violating the rights of others they are not allowed to publish, post, distribute or disseminate any inappropriate, threatening, infringing, obscene or unlawful topic, material, or information. To adhere to the principle of \u201cDo no harm\u201d we have moderation access in our \u201cForums\u201d section, which permits our partner organizations to moderate and remove content (user comments) that violates our terms, in some cases (when the users continue acting the same way after two notifications) the moderators have the right to block the users, who create content violating our terms. For now, the moderation in the platform is done manually by moderating the content daily. We are also currently working on functionality so that the users and contributors can report the abusive comments from mobile App and management dashboard, respectively. The Terms and Conditions as well as our Privacy Policies clearly describe these circumstances, and the users give consent to such data sharing. We ensure the security of collected data both by technical and policy means, more specifically the number of personnel, who has access to such data is strictly limited, moreover all the personnel has signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which clearly define user\u2019s personal data as a confidential information subject to confidentiality terms, the NDAs also imply strict monetary penalties in case of breach.

Accessible and inclusive education: FOSS (Free Open Source Software) provides free access to high-quality educational resources, tools, and platforms, ensuring that students from all backgrounds can access educational materials and opportunities. This helps bridge the digital divide and promote inclusivity in education. \\r\\n2. Cost-effective solutions: FOSS is often free or available at a low cost, which reduces the financial burden on educational institutions. This allows schools to allocate their resources more effectively and reach a larger number of students, especially in resource-constrained settings. \\r\\n3. Collaborative learning: FOSS encourages collaboration and knowledge-sharing among students, teachers, and educational institutions. It enables the creation of online communities where educators can share resources, exchange ideas, and collaborate on the development of educational content. This fosters a culture of collaborative learning and innovation. \\r\\n4. Customization and adaptability: FOSS software can be customized and adapted to suit the specific needs and context of different schools and educational systems. This flexibility allows teachers to tailor educational content and platforms to meet the diverse learning styles, interests, and capabilities of students, enhancing the quality and relevance of education. In FUSS we adapted the distribution for schools that need specific software e.g. music schools or certain technical schools.\\r\\n5. Digital literacy and innovation: FOSS software offers opportunities for students to develop digital literacy skills and encourages them to become active creators rather than just technology tourists. By engaging with FOSS projects, students can gain practical experience in coding, software development, and problem-solving. This nurtures their creativity, critical thinking, and innovation, aligning with SDG9\'s focus on industry and infrastructure development. \\r\\n6. Support for open educational resources (OER): FOSS software facilitates the creation, sharing, and use of open educational resources (OER). OER are freely accessible and adaptable learning materials that can be shared and reused, allowing educators to access a wide range of high-quality teaching resources. This promotes the use of up-to-date, relevant, and localized educational content, fostering the delivery of quality education. \\r\\n\\r\\n [SDG 9] FOSS in schools can play a significant role in fulfilling SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). Here are some ways in which the FUSS Project and FOSS, in general, can contribute: \\r\\n1. Cost-effectiveness and accessibility: FOSS software is typically available for free or at low costs, eliminating the need for expensive licenses or ongoing fees. This allows e.g. start-ups that want to work with schools with a FOSS-based business model, to cut initial costs while providing development and maintenance services for schools. This is what happened and happens with Project FUSS where its technological partners helped the project flourish keeping it up-to-date with free modern technologies. One of our technological partners was a student in one of our schools who helped develop the FUSS distribution voluntarily almost daily. \\r\\n2. Innovation and collaboration: FOSS software encourages collaboration among companies, as it allows users to access, modify, distribute, and exchange the source code freely. In schools, this fosters creativity and innovation by enabling students to experiment, customize, and develop their coding and programming skills which can be spent during compulsory internships in IT companies or public institutions. Through such collaborative practices, FOSS software promotes industry innovation, laying the foundation for future technological advancements. \\r\\n3. Skill development: By embracing FOSS software, schools can provide students with hands-on experience and practical knowledge of coding, programming, and software development. These skills are highly sought after in the job market and can empower students to pursue careers in industries related to technology and innovation, contributing to the overall growth of the economy. \\r\\n4. Infrastructure development: FOSS software often requires lower hardware specifications compared to proprietary alternatives, making it more adaptable to different types of infrastructure and devices. This flexibility allows schools to optimize their existing infrastructure and extend the lifespan of their hardware, reducing the need for constant upgrades or replacements. Consequently, FOSS software supports the development and maintenance of sustainable and resilient infrastructure. For years our schools have been using refurbished hardware to save money, and natural resources, and contribute to a circular economy. \\r\\n5. Localized solutions: FOSS software provides the opportunity for schools and local communities to create and adapt technology solutions to address specific challenges. This empowers educators, students, and local developers to cater to their unique needs and find innovative solutions to problems related to education, infrastructure, or social development. By promoting localized innovation, FOSS software supports the achievement of SDG9 at a grassroots level.

These included healthcare workers and professionals as well as volunteers - this was launched on the Integrated Government Online training portal. This effort utilized Sunbird Obsrv to measure and generate metrics on the number of individuals being trained, the extent of their training completion as well as system performance. This was an instrumental effort in training several thousands of frontline workers in the fight against Covid. This measure was undertaken by the National Health Mission and was also part of the operational guidelines from the Ministry of Health. This effort is in line with goal #3.d of the global framework. ,\\r\\n \\r\\nQuality Education: Sunbird building blocks have been adopted by the Ministry of Education, Government of India to launch a national school education platform called DIKSHA, which has been used extensively in each of the 36 States and Union Territories in India across 30+ languages. Measurement of usage data, which has been made possible by Sunbird Obsrv indicates widespread and intensive use of the platform.

It has logged 37 billion minutes of learning from over 3 billion sessions, with over a million teachers accessing curriculum-linked digital content available in 31 languages. In addition, around 3 million teachers have completed close to 7 million courses from over the 2,600 online course options available as part of their continuing professional development. Education leadership is another domain that Sunbird Obsrv has been successfully deployed in. In this context, we see Sunbird Obsrv being used towards promoting inclusive and equitable quality education and enabling lifelong learning for all, in line with Goal #4 of the global framework referred to above. ,\\r\\n \\r\\nDecent work and economic growth: Skilling, talent transformation, and capacity building for employability is another area that Sunbird Obsrv will extensively be used in - tracking user learning progress, measurement of scores for questions and assessments as well as measuring user engagement is a key capability enabled by Sunbird Obsrv on scalable and powerful learning platforms that are deployed by corporates as well as government-led skilling agencies alike.

Born as a response to the persistent problem of sexual harassment on the streets of Egypt, to which society had become increasingly tolerant. It was the first independent initiative to work on this issue and was launched in December 2010 by a founding group of four women together with tech partners, advisers, and volunteers. It generated mass public dialogue, pushed the National Council for Women and several members of parliament to draft new laws, inspired a first successful court case, and encouraged women\'s NGOs who had previously been reluctant to take on this issue, to form an 18 member NGO Task Force on Sexual Harassment. In an independent review (https://www.ushahidi.com/in-action/towards-a-safer-city) of Harassmap.org, they concluded that the Ushahidi map is an effective tool for data collection for sensitive issues, encouraging more participation and sometimes more truthful reports than other typical data collection means. \\r\\n \\r\\nSDG6: Following the COVID pandemic, there was increased use of the Ushahidi platform globally by organizations and individuals self-organizing to provide mutual aid, document COVID-19 testing experiences, and create visibility on where to access essential resources for vulnerable communities. Ushahidi supported over 2000 deployments in over 140 countries. One such engagement was Humanitarian Open Street Maps (HOT) in Indonesia which set up a deployment to track and publicize handwashing stations across Indonesia to allow easier access for residents. The idea was inspired by early expert advice deeming handwashing as an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. \\r\\n \\r\\nSDG13: Ushahidi was one of four organizations to win a Global Adaptation Index (GAIN) Prize in its inaugural year for its adaptation to urbanization, population growth, climate change, and other global challenges (https://www.ushahidi.com/about/blog/ushahidi-wins-global-adaptation-index-prize). One such climate change deployment is the Hatfield Climate Resilience-MVP Plan which crowdsourced information about Hatfield and its climate resilience (https://mvp.ushahidi.io/views/map). A second example is the Tana River Climate Change & Livelihoods Restoration Project (https://tclirp.ushahidi.io/views/map) by World Vision Kenya which aimed to contribute to enabling environmental policy implementation, governance, and environmental management through evidence generation using crowd geo-tagging. Case study report: https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/resources/climate-change-adaptation-and-livelihood-restoration-in-tana-river-delta/?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=WVK\\r\\n \\r\\nSDG 16: On good governance, Ushahidi was born out of an electoral crisis in Kenya. Ushahidi in practice can be read in the published paper titled \u201cCrowdsourcing Accountability in a Nigerian Election\u201d in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics by Catie Snow Bailard & Steven Livingston, proving that the use of Ushahidi \u2013 ReclaimNaija (http://www.reclaimnaija.net/)- increased voter turnout in the 2011 Nigerian election by 8%). Additionally,  Ushahidi has been used to monitor elections in India, Zambia, Mozambique, Nigeria, the USA, and many other countries over the past decade. Our strategy has evolved from primarily reactionary to proactively engaging with ordinary citizens and stakeholders to help foster transparency and accountability in elections.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations (UN) has a long history of working to maintain peace and security around the world. It strives to improve relations among nations and protect human rights. A second use case of SDG 16 is The UN Department of Field Services which used the Ushahidi platform for its peacekeeping operations. Called SAGE\u2014Situational Awareness Geospatial Enterprise\u2014the UN used the Ushahidi platform to collect, process and disseminate information from their field staff so the mission HQ has a better understanding of what\u2019s happening on the ground, can triage accordingly, and can make better decisions."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"AGPL-3.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/blob/develop/LICENSE.md"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Ushahidi Inc.","clearOwnershipURL":"Terms of Service: https://www.ushahidi.com/terms-of-service/"}],"documentation":"https://docs.ushahidi.com/platform-developer-documentation/","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"Exporting Data from Ushahidi:\\r\\nUshahidi provides export functionality within the user interface using the platform APIs.

For example:\\r\\n\u2022 The French Ministry for Foreign Affairs leveraging data collected by the German Universit\xe4t Bremen.\\r\\n\u2022 The Swiss NGO HestiaLabs.ai collaborating with French consumer protection association UFC-QueChoisir following their common contributions to Open Terms Archive.\\r\\n\u2022 American NGO Reset.tech providing data to researchers around the world through Open Terms Archive: https://www.reset.tech/resources/memos-on-platforms-behaviour-during-the-2022-french-elections/\\r\\n\u2022 American members of Congress using joint achievements of the ToS;DR NGO and Open Terms Archive in Europe to support domestic legislation mandating more transparency in terms of use: https://trahan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2353\\r\\n\\r\\nSDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: Open Terms Archive ensures accountability and transparency in digital infrastructure and digital service providers. While digital tools and digital infrastructure constitute an increasingly large part of development efforts, the terms offered by providers vary widely across jurisdictions. Open Terms Archive enables time-based as well as jurisdiction-based difference tracking, meaning it can show the difference between the terms offered by providers in varying countries. It also facilitates ensuring compliance by tracking changes following the enactment of legislation. For example, when the Malabo Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection will be ratified within the African Union, authorities and civil society will be able to check which private actors comply within the 30 days window that will be provided to them."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"EUPL-1.2","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"- Engine: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/blob/main/LICENSE\\r\\n- Website: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/OpenTermsArchive.org/blob/main/LICENSE\\r\\n- Ontology: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/terms-types/blob/main/LICENSE\\r\\n- Main collection: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-declarations/blob/main/LICENSE\\r\\n- Main dataset: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/blob/main/LICENSE"},{"openLicense":"ODC-By-1.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"- Engine: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/blob/main/LICENSE\\r\\n- Website: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/OpenTermsArchive.org/blob/main/LICENSE\\r\\n- Ontology: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/terms-types/blob/main/LICENSE\\r\\n- Main collection: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-declarations/blob/main/LICENSE\\r\\n- Main dataset: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/blob/main/LICENSE"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Open Terms Archive Collective","clearOwnershipURL":"https://opentermsarchive.org/about"}],"documentation":"- Technical documentation: https://docs.opentermsarchive.org\\r\\n- Contributor documentation: https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/contributing-terms/\\r\\n- User documentation: https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/how-to/navigate-history/\\r\\n- JavaScript API documentation: https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/jsdoc/","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"All the data collected by Open Terms Archive consists of publicly available terms of services.\\r\\nThey are stored by default on the filesystem in HTML and Markdown format, and can be accessed directly on the filesystem or through the JavaScript API exposed by the engine.\\r\\nOptional adapters can be developed by contributors to interact with other database formats."},"openStandards":["- SSH \u2192 https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/deployment\\r\\n- SSL \u2192 https://opentermsarchive.org\\r\\n- UTF-8 \u2192 https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/contributing-terms/#service-name and test example: https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/blob/main/src/archivist/recorder/index.test.js#L37\\r\\n- HTML"," CSS and ECMAScript \u2192 https://opentermsarchive.org\\r\\n- ECMAScript \u2192 ESLint runs on every change"," see https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/blob/main/package.json#L39\\r\\n- OpenAPI \u2192 generated from annotations"," see https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/blob/9c236c7f18bf4888539def7c9d80e8d0876ddf4a/src/api/routes/services.js#L7-L56 and UI demo on http://54.37.5.206/api/v1/\\r\\n- JSON \u2192 schemas available on https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/blob/main/scripts/declarations/validate/service.schema.js and validated in CI"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is NOT collected NOT stored and NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":[],"dataPrivacySecurity":""},"userContent":{"contentManagement":"Content is collected stored and distributed.","contentTypes":["Contractual documents of online services"," such as Terms of Use"," Privacy Policy\u2026"],"contentManagementPolicy":"Every contribution to track a document is reviewed a priori by a well-identified collection maintainer.\\r\\nUntil the review has been done, no content is collected, stored nor distributed.\\r\\nAs Open Terms Archive is decentralised, each collection maintainer sets its own standards, processes and delays for review."},"protectionFromHarassment":{"facilitatesUserInteraction":"Yes","harassmentPolicy":"Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct -

Steps are being taken to introduce X-Road on a global basis, to allow either the World Health Organization (WHO) or its member states to set up various cross-border services to help the global community emerge faster from the COVID-19 health and economic crisis.,\\r\\n \\r\\nEnergy efficiency, renewables and consumer centricity figure among the lines of action to boost the transition towards cleaner energy systems \u2013 ways of producing, delivering and consuming energy in a more sustainable way. The deployment of information technology has a significant impact on the feasibility of contemporary policy actions. X-Road is helping electricity grid operators by harmonising access to energy data. By simplifying access to data lets them focus on the solutions to achieve energy and climate goals.,\\r\\n \\r\\nX-Road enables reduction of administrative burdens by the implementation of the Once-Only Principle (TOOP). Streamlined administrative processes support economic growth and enable providing better services for the citizens. For example, in Estonia, X-Road saved 1,134 working years during the previous calendar year. X-Road helps a country to become a hassle-free environment for business and entrepreneurship, which also attracts foreign investments.,\\r\\n \\r\\nX-Road provides national core digital infrastructure for data exchange between organizations across administration sectors and business domains. Typically, the ecosystem is open for all kinds of organizations \u2013 both public and private sector organizations. Besides, X-Road can be used to implement cross-border data exchange with other countries. X-Road enables allocating resources for building digital services and fostering innovation, instead of integrating services point-to-point.,\\r\\n \\r\\nThe use of digital services reduces the need to travel between different locations which reduces traffic in the cities. When travelling is needed, digital services provide information about different transportation and route alternatives and may prioritise the most environmentally friendly alternatives. X-Road is a crucial enabler that\u2019s needed to make numerous information systems to communicate with each other. By establishing or joining an X-Road environment, cities and municipalities can request up-to-date information from relevant public registers and increase their effectiveness.,\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) aims to develop X-Road the most sustainable data exchange solution in the world. The short-term goal is to focus on the X- Road software\'s direct and tangible environmental impacts. NIIS conducted research focusing on assessing the current emissions profile across X-Road\'s operations and services to give targeted recommendations for emissions reduction and sustainable business practices.,\\r\\n \\r\\nX-Road is a solution to fight against corruption and helps in building trust towards institutions. X-Road provides log records of each message sent between X-Road ecosystem member organisations. The log records provide undeniable evidence of a transaction, and they could be used in process automation to reduce manual work, increase the level of automation in various processes and make things easier for both users of different information systems and citizens. X-Road also provides many features that are required from MyData platform technology."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"MIT","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/LICENSE"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS)","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/LICENSE"}],"documentation":"https://docs.x-road.global\\r\\nhttps://x-road.global/resources","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"The non-PII data can be exported from the system using the X-Road Operational Monitoring Protocol:\\r\\nhttps://docs.x-road.global/OperationalMonitoring/Protocols/pr-opmon_x-road_operational_monitoring_protocol_Y-1096-2.html"},"openStandards":["RFC6960","RFC3161","ETSITS 102 918 https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Architecture/arc-ss_x-road_security_server_architecture.md "],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["https://www.niis.org/blog/2018/5/27/x-road-logs-basics"],"dataPrivacySecurity":"https://x-road.global/security"},"userContent":{"contentManagement":"Content is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","contentTypes":["https://www.niis.org/blog/2018/5/27/x-road-logs-basics"],"contentManagementPolicy":"It is the sole responsibility of the governing authorities in each country that deploy the X-Road data exchange layer.

Data collected in E-Heza supports reporting on all SDG 2.2 indicators. Additionally, E-Heza will be used to monitor the impact of Rwanda\u2019s national nutrition and childhood development program.  In the health centers that have implemented E-Heza, there has been a 27% drop in severe malnutrition after three visits. ,\\r\\n \\r\\nE-Heza supports the good health and well being goal by providing healthcare workers with an efficient interface for providing maternal and child healthcare according to protocols and international standards, and to pass patient data, including diagnosis and treatments, across levels of care.    Among the hundreds of healthcare workers using E-Heza, quality of care has been shown to have increased by 120% and have documented 150 minutes saved per patient interaction. E-Heza supports comprehensive primary care across the entire spectrum of maternal and child health, as well as non-communicable diseases of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Data collected can easily provide reports on most SDG indicators, particularly for SDG 3.1 (Decrease global maternal mortality), SDG 3.2 (End preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5), SDG 3.3 (Fight communicable diseases), SDG 3.4 (Reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health), and SDG 3.8 (Achieve Universal Health Coverage- RMNCH branch).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast majority of frontline health workers (70%) in East Africa are women; yet, less than 25% of women  hold  leadership roles that give them authority to improve the systems where they work. Female frontline health workers are generally paid 28%  less than men for comparable work in East Africa, and are more likely to suffer from burnout. Burnout is known to contribute to poor quality care. These conditions are even worse in the rural (Rwanda and Burundi)  and peri-urban (Somalia)  areas where we work. By decreasing workloads and nurturing the passion of frontline health workers, care quality is improving, families are participating in their care, and health outcomes are improving. This allows us to impact SDG5 (Gender Equity) and SDG8 (Decent Work) by decreasing workloads and strengthening skills of frontline health workers."},"openlicenses":[{"openLicense":"Apache-2.0","openLicenseEvidenceURLs":"https://github.com/TIP-Global-Health/eheza-app/blob/main/LICENSE.txt"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"TIP Global Health","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/TIP-Global-Health/eheza-app/blob/main/LICENSE.txt"}],"documentation":"User and Admin Documentation: https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/,\\r\\nDeveloper Community Documentation: https://github.com/TIP-Global-Health/eheza-app","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"Non-PII data can be extracted using the export function within the E-Heza backend application.

This policy is available here - https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/policy_docs/do-no-harm/.  E-Heza\'s \'Do No Harm\' approach focuses on patient and caregiver safety by: \\r\\n1. Preventing Errors:\\r\\n - \\r\\nE-Heza\'s decision logic model and all aspects of clinical care are governed by a clinical review process that includes physicians, healthcare workers, and digital health specialists. This work is reviewed by the E-Heza Executive committee. \\r\\n- Development work is open source and follows a peer review process in which all code is first reviewed by another developer before it is submitted to the QA process. \\r\\n- E-Heza adheres to best practices  privacy and data security standards to ensure the protection of private patient information. \\r\\n2. Learning from mistakes: \\r\\n- TIP Global Health\'s Model is based on gathering feedback and acting on it. There is a regular process of understanding challenges and potential errors which may cause harm. (https://tipglobalhealth.org/our-model/) \\r\\n- The feedback process is governed by the E-Heza Executive committee and overseen by the TIP Global Health Steering Committee. \\r\\n3. Promoting a culture of safety through safe practices and safe systems. \\r\\n - E-Heza\u2019s training model is built to encourage co-design and encourages the foundational feedback mechanisms in order to understand both errors of omission and errors of commission. TIP  Global Health takes the following steps to ensure the privacy and security of data collected: \\r\\n- Healthcare workers sign and commit to a \u201cProtected Health Information Confidentiality Agreement\u201d and receive initial and ongoing training regarding privacy and security. \\r\\n - Access to E-Heza\u2019s backend (where private data is held) is secured with role-based permission access and only site administrators with proper need are given access to private data. \\r\\n- Transfer of data between E-Heza\u2019s front-end client and backend storage is through SSL-encrypted channels only and performed only with authenticated devices. \\r\\n- E-Heza maintains an access log which tracks all access and both to backend accounts and front end data collection. Weekly audits are performed on the access logs, and the  logs are maintained for one year (and then archived through the prescribed backup retention plan). \\r\\n- E-Heza\u2019s development operation prohibits the use of non-anonymized data in the development process. No developer may hold personal information on their local system to transfer any personal information from a non-production environment outside the course of the normal backup procedure. \\r\\n - E-Heza engages in third-party security audits in order to procure recommendations for further privacy and security procedures."},"userContent":{"contentManagement":"Content is NOT collected NOT stored and NOT distributed.","contentTypes":[],"contentManagementPolicy":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"facilitatesUserInteraction":"Yes","harassmentPolicy":"E-Heza is designed to be used only by healthcare workers and implementing organizations are responsible for screening healthcare workers for age.

It is also worth noting the unique online course available on the website"," which acts as a practical tool for creating and developing safe and comfortable settlements. The project proved its sustainability in the long term: it was originally made for only one city"," and then expanded and grew into a map for the whole republic. The next step is obtaining a status of Digital Public Good as a pathfinding pilot project run by UNICEF in Kazakhstan. As a potential future direction of development"," we consider using artificial intelligence in the information system. In addition to cooperation with UNICEF"," close interaction with site users and recipients of the benefits should be noted: the ability to supplement and amend the map is open to all registered users. Thus"," the project encourages the activity of civil society and increases the level of individual responsibility for accessible"," safe and comfortable public space.

Develop and validate user scenarios: test cases where written which cover main user journeys and scenarios.

(ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \\r\\n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \\r\\n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example"," in Indonesia"," encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \\r\\n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal & invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. It\u2019s theory of change includes scaling. In addition"," Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \\r\\n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition"," there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Oky\u2019s privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards"," open source. \\r\\n 1.

UNBL contains several relevant layers associated with the SDG.  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for crops and flooded vegetation. \\r\\n\\r\\nExample: The Marine Priority Areas for Food Security layer identifies priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision, and carbon storage.  Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03371-z  \\r\\n\\r\\nExample: the Crop Suitability Change layer shows general agricultural suitability considering rain-fed conditions and irrigation on currently irrigated areas. The dataset covers two time periods (2011-2040, 2071-2100), as well as changes in agricultural suitability over two periods (1981-2100, 2011-2100).\\r\\n \\r\\nSDG6 - UNBL provides a number of layers related to water provision and essential watersheds.  Example: The Nature Map Realised Clean Water Provision layer consists of a globally normalized map (from 0 to 1) of pixels ranked for their relative importance in delivering clean water to downstream beneficiaries. Example: The City Water Map layer contains information on the water sources for 534 cities internationally. The watershed layer shown here includes information about the catchment area of the watershed that supplies these cities.\\r\\n \\r\\nSDG11 - Mapping urban areas, and trends in urban development is relevant here. At 10m scale users can also start to identify large green spaces in urban areas and agricultural peripheries. UNBL provides a number of layers related to this.  Example: The Global Grid of Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030 layer presents spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land cover change from 2000 to 2030 at a 2.5 arc-minute resolution. Citation: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211658109  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for Built Areas. \\r\\n \\r\\nSDG13 - UNBL provides a number of layers that relate to carbon sequestration and climate change scenarios. Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to nature-based solutions for climate change. \\r\\n \\r\\nUNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas. UNBL draws protected area data directly from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Protected Areas offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to Protected Areas.
