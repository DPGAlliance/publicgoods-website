In CHT apps that support messaging with patients, the relevant patients are enrolled and consented into the process by a trained health worker. To our knowledge there have not been any deployments of CHT apps in which minors were enrolled in use of the system. One of the four core principles of the CHT community is that we are committed to designing CHT systems in a human-centered manner. In our view, this is not merely a buzzword or a statement of ethical priorities. Rather, it is a set of rigorous methods that work within a flexible yet disciplined process to prioritize people\u2019s needs and concrete experiences in the design of digital systems. An essential feature of human-centered design is that it prioritizes the dignity and agency of end users. It is also explicitly iterative and takes responsibility for making adaptations to address any potential unintended effects of a system - such as a situation in which health workers might experience grief or abuse from a peer or supervisor via their digital tool. We have conducted extensive research and members of our team are considered global authorities on the topic of human-centered design for global health, we consider this approach to be a thorough and substantive means of addressing lived experiences of harassment and abuse in health systems.

The core idea behind the Reporting Module is to provide a solid foundation so that other developers can use the framework to implement new reporting features. OpenMRS implementers have used modules to create many different types of reports and formats (including CSV, TSV, HTML, XML, etc). The Reporting module is used to extract non-PII data in a multi-column format where each row represents the object and each column represents an attribute associated with the object. Other modules, such as the REST module or FHIR2 module, allow import/export of non-PII data using REST APIs or HL7 FHIR APIs.

Unified - Use a single model for both batch and streaming use cases, can handle batch and streaming data with no need to write different logics separately. \\n 2. Portable - Able to execute pipelines on multiple execution environments, clear separation on the programming layer with the runtime layer. This means code can be migrated to any supported execution engine (runner). 3. Extensible - Ability to write and share new SDK\u2019s IO connectors and any transformation libraries. \\n Ona\u2019s Preference for Beam: \\n Our newly built Beam ETL Tool is the tool of choice for performing data ingestion in our all systems, this stems from the above-mentioned features of Beam, its simple deployment feature that is fully managed and auto-configured; we just need to deploy the pipeline (no-ops service). Additionally, Beam ETL offers horizontal scaling that happens automatically based on a set step by step process and a configurable durability. We are moving our ETL tools that were previously built on Apache NiFi to our newly implemented BEAM ETL Tool, this has been necessitated by some challenges (save for the positive features) experienced with NiFi as itemized below; \\n- Challenging stateful ETL in NiFi - it has no generic mechanisms for remembering where it stopped hence makes it hard for tracking complex ETL processes. -Poor performance in NiFi - breaking up a data transformation into multiple serialized steps is expensive, and limits NiFi\u2019s ETL rate pretty severely when compared to a coded multi-step solution. \\n - Poor queueing behavior, NiFi cannot buffer large numbers of flow files without major performance problems"},"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["Health information on people"],"dataPrivacySecurity":" We try to ensure our health apps always follow WHO approved health guidelines.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a global standard security framework built on a role-based permissions management model that manages access at both the broad and granular levels by aligning the assigned permissions role with the organizational role of the user. RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \\n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication. PKI governs the issuance of digital certificates to protect sensitive data, provide unique digital identities for users, devices, and applications, and secure end-to-end communications. \\n- Reveals\u2019 infrastructure \xeds protected and encapsulated within a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Access to these components is governed via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), implementing the OpenVPN protocol.

It uses a traditional security protocol based on the  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. \\n - Data transmission between Reveal Android client and Reveal Server is protected by the TLS encryption protocol.

Currently we live in a technological age where children and adolescents live a normality that consists of the use of technological tools. They get bored easily, the way in which information is presented to them is not very motivating and school is no longer the only means of access to education. There are different tools through which they can acquire knowledge, however the minimum has a pedagogical basis. Due to the aforementioned, we must innovate in the teaching-learning process. Currently there are new teaching methodologies, with a focus on active learning and the development of skills through play. One of these methodologies is gamification. Different authors define it as a process in which game mechanisms are used to attract people, promote learning and solve problems. The purpose is to motivate the player\'s behavior. Elements in the game such as points, avatars or levels, increase the psychological predisposition of the player to continue in it. This makes gamification an ally of education. Currently there are game developers who use platforms like Godot, however they do not have the pedagogical knowledge to add elements that help the user to consolidate their learning. That\'s why Pixframe Studios is developing a plugin for the Godot Engine: a tool to help new game developers and serious game teams create new games with the goal of aiding in the development of education. As mentioned before, Latin America is still trying to develop new tools to improve their educational field, nevertheless they don\'t have enough knowledge nor tools to achieve it. The plugin is open source so that the community in Latin America can access new ways of creating video games with a pedagogical basis. In this way, code is created, optimized and shared. Educational material can be shared in an innovative way and finally a stock of illustrative material is generated such as button icons, backgrounds for games, fonts and unique Godot Engine assets."}],"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Pixframe Studios","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot"}],"documentation":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot/blob/main/README.md,https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot/blob/main/How%20to%20use","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"openStandards":["GDScript basics standard","Open Source Initiative Open Standard Requirements https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/open-standards.html#requirements","https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html","https://opensource.org/licenses/category Use Open Standards","Open Source","Understand the Existing Ecosystem"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["TOWI may collect information from its SUBSCRIBERS"," through our Site"," of the following types:","- Personal Information such as: Full name"," date of birth"," age"," place of birth"," address"," telephone"," family data or references"," email"," occupation"," gender"," academic level"," university career"," work or professional experience"," interests"," country"," region or state.

Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to nature-based solutions for climate change.  Example layer included in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet.

At 10m scale users can also start to identify large green spaces in urban areas and agricultural peripheries. UNBL provides a number of layers related to this.  Example: The Global Grid of Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030 layer presents spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land cover change from 2000 to 2030 at a 2.5 arc-minute resolution. Citation: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211658109  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for Built Areas. Example in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL provides a number of layers that relate to carbon sequestration and climate change scenarios. Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to nature-based solutions for climate change.  Example layer included in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas. UNBL draws protected area data directly from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).

UNBL contains several relevant layers associated with the SDG.  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for crops and flooded vegetation. Example: The Marine Priority Areas for Food Security layer identifies priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision and carbon storage.  Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03371-z  Example: the Crop Suitability Change layer shows general agricultural suitability considering rain-fed conditions and irrigation on currently irrigated areas.The dataset covers two time periods (2011-2040, 2071-2100), as well as changes in agricultural suitability over two periods (1981-2100, 2011-2100). Example layer in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL provides a number of layers related to water provision and essential watersheds.  Example: The Nature Map Realised Clean Water Provision layer consists of a globally normalized map (from 0 to 1) of pixels ranked for their relative importance in delivering clean water to downstream beneficiaries. Example: The City Water Map layer contains information on the water sources for 534 cities internationally.

Design with the user: The system has been designed and evolved during the past 20 years in close collaboration with the Norwegian Agricultural Advisory service. Workshops with farmers have been held several times during this period"," where feedback has led to improvements and new features.","2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem: In addition to the Norwegian advisors; farmers"," researchers and advisors in Sweden"," Finland"," Denmark"," Lihtuania"," Latvia"," Switzerland"," Bosnia-Hercegovina and India have been consulted. Through various international projects"," the needs and the potential for VIPS have been clarified.","3. Design for Scale - Build for Sustainability: The system is funded on a long-term basis in Norway for Norwegian users. The system may be installed anywhere else as well"," given that the resources are available. The system is simple"," flexible and modular"," allowing for scaling in almost any situation imaginable.","4. Open Standards: VIPS is Open Source and uses standards wherever possible in order to make communication between VIPS and external systems as easy as possible.","5. Reuse and Improve: By using Open Source software for building and as APIs/dependencies of the project"," only the functionality specific of VIPS has been developed uniquely for the project.","6. Privacy & Security: Has been described in other parts of the DPG form.","7.

According to the 2018 Disability & Development Report from the UN, \'persons with disabilities are at a disadvantage regarding most Sustainable Development Goals\', and \'concrete action is needed to include the world\'s one billion persons with disabilities, as both agents and beneficiaries of development\'. Barriers to inclusion and participation are exacerbated by the lack of access to affordable, relevant assistive technology. According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in people with disabilities engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability. Digital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure \'no one is left behind\' in our increasingly digital world.

Design with the User\\r\\nWith the general public"," LGUs"," policymakers"," and public health officials as intended target users of AEDES"," we developed the application on a user-friendly web interface for ease of accessibility. We have presented this to WHO Philippines and we have gotten feedback from a healthcare professional on how and what to improve in the application\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Understand the Existing Ecosystem\\r\\nDengue is already an existing public health problem not only in the Philippines and but also in many Asian and Latin American countries. As the product needs to be improved further"," we are working with other researchers and scoping for funding opportunities\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Design for Scale\\r\\nWe are now closely working with other researchers to further improve AEDES. We want to expand the functionalities of AEDES and incorporate a dengue risk index. We have used the MVC Framework (Model"," View"," Controller) which isolates application functionality into self-contained components. We also utilized the API from Sentinel Copernicus Satellites to get satellite images with vast date ranges.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.Build for Sustainability\\r\\nSince the data captured is from global and public remote sensing service"," the application can continue gathering data. There is a plan to create a social enterprise around the dengue prediction service"," by incorporating other risk frameworks"," we can generalize the process and ensure that other indicators will also be integrated. The results and/or insights will be offered on a subscription basis.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Be Data Driven\\r\\nData"," as it moves along its value chain from creation to actionable insights"," underpins the overall workflow of AEDES. Also"," by leveraging the three main disciplines of analytics - Descriptive"," Predictive"," and Prescriptive"," AEDES facilitates a holistic approach to dengue prevention and control and empowers its intended users to make informed decisions. \\r\\n\\r\\n6. Use Open Standards"," Open Data"," Open Source"," and Open Innovation\\r\\nAEDES was built through an open innovation challenge by NASA"," we also advocate the use of Open Source technologies such as Python"," PHP for tools"," QGIS for geospatial analysis"," Sentinel  Copernicus Satellites for data"," and government sources for weather and health-related data. AEDES prototype is also publicly hosted 24/7 for free. We welcome collaborators to improve and provide feedback to the AEDES implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Reuse and Improve\\r\\nAEDES at its core was developed by reusing prior work by other researchers. By combining three research papers related to using social listening"," stagnant water detection"," and dengue prediction we have developed the application. We are planning on using other research to integrate risk frameworks to improve the current workflow of AEDES.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Address Privacy & Security\\r\\nWe don\'t collect"," store"," or transfer any personal information. AEDES website also uses HTTPS (Positive SSL) for website security. \\r\\n\\r\\n9.

Data collected can easily provide reports on most SDG indicators, particularly for SDG 3.1 (Decrease global maternal mortality), SDG 3.2 (End preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5), SDG 3.3 (Fight communicable diseases), SDG 3.4 (Reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health), and SDG 3.8 (Achieve Universal Health Coverage- RMNCH branch)."}],"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/TIP-Global-Health/eheza-app"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"TIP Global Health","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/TIP-Global-Health/eheza-app/blob/main/LICENSE.txt"}],"documentation":"https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/,https://github.com/TIP-Global-Health/eheza-app","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"Non-PII data can be extracted using the export function within the E-Heza backend application.

This policy is available here - https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/policy_docs/do-no-harm/.  E-Heza\'s \'Do No Harm\' approach focuses on patient and caregiver safety by: \\n1. Preventing Errors:\\n - \\nE-Heza\'s decision logic model and all aspects of clinical care are governed by a clinical review process that includes physicians, healthcare workers, and digital health specialists. This work is reviewed by the E-Heza Executive committee. \\n- Development work is open source and follows a peer review process in which all code is first reviewed by another developer before it is submitted to the QA process. \\n- E-Heza adheres to best practices  privacy and data security standards to ensure the protection of private patient information. \\n2. Learning from mistakes: \\n- TIP Global Health\'s Model is based on gathering feedback and acting on it. There is a regular process of understanding challenges and potential errors which may cause harm. (https://tipglobalhealth.org/our-model/) \\n- The feedback process is governed by the E-Heza Executive committee and overseen by the TIP Global Health Steering Committee. \\n3. Promoting a culture of safety through safe practices and safe systems. \\n - E-Heza\u2019s training model is built to encourage co-design and encourages the foundational feedback mechanisms in order to understand both errors of omission and errors of commission. TIP  Global Health takes the following steps to ensure the privacy and security of data collected: \\n- Healthcare workers sign and commit to a \u201cProtected Health Information Confidentiality Agreement\u201d and receive initial and ongoing training regarding privacy and security. \\n - Access to E-Heza\u2019s backend (where private data is held) is secured with role-based permission access and only site administrators with proper need are given access to private data. \\n- Transfer of data between E-Heza\u2019s front-end client and backend storage is through SSL-encrypted channels only and performed only with authenticated devices. \\n- E-Heza maintains an access log which tracks all access and both to backend accounts and front end data collection. Weekly audits are performed on the access logs, and the  logs are maintained for one year (and then archived through the prescribed backup retention plan). \\n- E-Heza\u2019s development operation prohibits the use of non-anonymized data in the development process. No developer may hold personal information on their local system to transfer any personal information from a non-production environment outside the course of the normal backup procedure. \\n - E-Heza engages in third-party security audits in order to procure recommendations for further privacy and security procedures."},"userContent":{"contentManagement":"Content is NOT collected NOT stored and NOT distributed.","contentTypes":[],"contentManagementPolicy":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"facilitatesUserInteraction":"Yes","harassmentPolicy":"E-Heza is designed to be used only by healthcare workers and implementing organizations are responsible for screening healthcare workers for age.

OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose. For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. In the context of OpenG2P, we consider \'stateless building blocks\' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII. Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: (a) Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. (b) Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. (c). If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together. The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens.

Beneficiaries should be aware of and consent to how their data are used for a program\u2019s interaction with external systems. 2. Inbound and outbound data flow with external systems should be via secured authentication and transport mechanisms. Such secured authentication and data transport should follow best practices in keeping with international norms and standards. Where network latency creates challenges for encrypted channels, data encryption alone may suffice as long as vulnerabilities are limited on the endpoints. 3. OpenG2P components individually and collectively obfuscate (e.g. encrypt) the data such that if it is hacked or taken out it is as good as unusable. 4.

Both of these targets require more efficient health supply chains, and that\u2019s a primary goal of PCMT.   In particular PCMT aims to achieve this by increasing the connectivity between health domains (e.g. clinical coding) and supply chain operations by allowing local product catalog contexts to be mapped to adjacent (e.g. public and private care and supply chains) and global (e.g. manufacturing, suppliers, shipping) contexts.  In our experience this work of mapping product catalog codings between contexts happens already, however the typical tools are spreadsheets and disconnected databases (e.g. regulatory or supplier).  PCMT aims to supplement the use of these disconnected datasets and associated people, and bring their workflow into a common tool and community of practice, where those stakeholders follow a workflow of data curation that fits changing health requirements (e.g. new diseases and their medicines) supply characteristics (availability, regulatory approval, lead times, cost). \\nAs evidence for the application of to both of these targets, PCMT is already in use as a backing technology to curate datasets for family planning, essential medicines, vaccines and other medical product catalogs, both in local and global operations teams."}],"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"VillageReach","clearOwnershipURL":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt/-/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.md"}],"documentation":"https://gitlab.com/pcmt/pcmt/-/wikis/home","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"Yes","nonPIIAccessMechanism":"Imports and exports into CSV or excel formats"},"openStandards":["FHIR","REST","JSON  Design w/ User"," understand ecosystem"," scale"," sustainability"," data driven"," open standards"," reuse and improve"," security"," collaborative"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["Name and email for admistrators"],"dataPrivacySecurity":" The product catalog system has PII on catalog administrators, however the catalog specifically discourages tying catalog entries to patients or procedures.
