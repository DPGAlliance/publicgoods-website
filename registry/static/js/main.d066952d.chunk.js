Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank\u2019s classification.   ,&#013; &#010;3. Good Health and Well-being Evidence: Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various disease areas within the health sector, including but not limited to, for national and sub-national HIV, TB, and Malaria programs. Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems.

Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: \u201cZenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,\u201d John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. \u201cThis model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda\u2019s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis\u2019 approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. \u201cWe attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,\u201d said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some partners pull out, saying: \u2018Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.\u2019\u201d ,&#013; &#010;5. Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis\u2019 software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis\u2019 analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: \u201cIn public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.\u201d Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA),&#013; &#010;6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a \u201cvirtual control room\u201d, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an \u201cmAlert system\u201d, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique\u2019s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.,&#013; &#010;8. Decent Work and Economic Growth Evidence: Zenysis is working with the Jobs Creation Commission (JCC) to establish a Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform to help the government manage and monitor its job creation programs. The platform, supported by Big Win Philanthropy, brings together a number of data sources to generate insights for policymakers, employers, job seekers and employment agencies.  Excerpt from Big Win Philanthropy Article: During this meeting, the delegation also learned about Ethiopia\u2019s Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform, developed by Zenysis Technologies to facilitate evidence-based decision-making through aggregating employment data from different information systems. Now in its second phase of expansion, the platform aggregates more than 20 data sources including job creation reports, education data, and labor force and employment surveys to create a national employment database and verify the accuracy of reports received from a variety of sources.,&#013; &#010;17. Partnerships for the Goals Evidence: The integration of data across multiple once siloed systems supports the partnership and coordination of both domestic and international stakeholders in each Harmony deployment. For example, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria is the largest global platform for coordinated action towards a world free from malaria and since July 2019, Zenysis Technologies has been working with the RBM partnership to enhance data sharing, coordination and action in the fight against malaria. Zenysis has developed the Global Malaria Monitoring Dashboard to strengthen regional and global reporting requirements, integrate data from different systems, and improve data visualization and management tools. The dashboards integrate epidemiological, programmatic, financial, supply chain, and other data from more than 30 countries."},{"sdg":"SDG3: Good Health and Well-Being","relevance":"For ALL: Harmony currently serves as the open source, data integration and data analytics platform for governments in 8 low-, middle- and upper-middle income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Once data has been integrated, it is being used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response.

Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis\u2019 software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis\u2019 analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services.

Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a \u201cvirtual control room\u201d, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an \u201cmAlert system\u201d, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis.

Excerpt from Big Win Philanthropy Article: During this meeting, the delegation also learned about Ethiopia\u2019s Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform, developed by Zenysis Technologies to facilitate evidence-based decision-making through aggregating employment data from different information systems. Now in its second phase of expansion, the platform aggregates more than 20 data sources including job creation reports, education data, and labor force and employment surveys to create a national employment database and verify the accuracy of reports received from a variety of sources.,&#013; &#010;17. Partnerships for the Goals Evidence: The integration of data across multiple once siloed systems supports the partnership and coordination of both domestic and international stakeholders in each Harmony deployment. For example, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria is the largest global platform for coordinated action towards a world free from malaria and since July 2019, Zenysis Technologies has been working with the RBM partnership to enhance data sharing, coordination and action in the fight against malaria. Zenysis has developed the Global Malaria Monitoring Dashboard to strengthen regional and global reporting requirements, integrate data from different systems, and improve data visualization and management tools. The dashboards integrate epidemiological, programmatic, financial, supply chain, and other data from more than 30 countries."},{"sdg":"SDG17: Partnerships for the Goals","relevance":"For ALL: Harmony currently serves as the open source, data integration and data analytics platform for governments in 8 low-, middle- and upper-middle income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is also used by the RBM Partnership to End Malaria for global coordination of the malaria response. Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank\u2019s classification.   ,&#013; &#010;3. Good Health and Well-being Evidence: Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various disease areas within the health sector, including but not limited to, for national and sub-national HIV, TB, and Malaria programs. Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data has been integrated, it is being used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: \u201cZenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,\u201d John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. \u201cThis model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda\u2019s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis\u2019 approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. \u201cWe attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,\u201d said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some partners pull out, saying: \u2018Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.\u2019\u201d ,&#013; &#010;5. Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis\u2019 software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis\u2019 analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: \u201cIn public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.\u201d Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA),&#013; &#010;6. Clean Water and Sanitation Evidence: Harmony can be used to integrate a myriad of cross-sectoral data systems that can be utilized for analysis. For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a \u201cvirtual control room\u201d, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an \u201cmAlert system\u201d, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique\u2019s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.,&#013; &#010;8. Decent Work and Economic Growth Evidence: Zenysis is working with the Jobs Creation Commission (JCC) to establish a Jobs Enablement and Data Interoperability (JEDI) platform to help the government manage and monitor its job creation programs.

Create user personas: was undertaken at inception point. The UI/UX designer in collaboration with the Oky team created profiles of the target audience. \\n2. Develop and validate user scenarios: test cases where written which cover main user journeys and scenarios. During user testing carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019"," the main user cases were tested by Oky\'s target users. \\n 3. Develop methods for user feedback and input throughout the product lifestyle: (i) Target audience (adolescent girls in Indonesia and Mongolia) was consulted during the development of Oky MVP. They selected avatars"," colours and main functionalities. (ii) User testing was carried out in Mongolia and Indonesia in 2019 to help identify and iterate the features which were not intuitive or easy to use for target audience.","Understand the existing ecosystem. \\n 1. Map out current and past digital development initiatives: this was done prior to the commencement of the work. Documentation is available. \\n 2. Understand the local protocols you need to take into account: All content is adapted by country teams/local partners to ensure it is locally and culturally relevant. For example"," in Indonesia"," encyclopedia content was localized during the development of the product (prior to launch) to fulfill local government requirements in Indonesia.","Design for scale. \\n 1. Develop a theory of change that includes scale as a goal & invest time to plan for a tool that could scale: Oky was developed from the onset with scale in mind. It\u2019s theory of change includes scaling. In addition"," Oky was built in a modular approach so that new features could easily be added and removed. All of the app components and assets were segregated so they could easily be swapped out when rolling the product out to new countries. A white-label version was also placed on the GitHub repository to facilitate scaling to new countries by any interested party.","Be data driven. \\n 1. Identify and address the risks associated with data privacy and security: no personally identifiable information is requested or kept in our records to ensure the privacy of our users. In addition"," there is a privacy policy that outlines how the data is kept safe. Oky\u2019s privacy policy can be found on the Oky website (https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lW1SV-DrO4XsninP_SsMj424RDcCOapG96BS0OxSoo/preview)","Use open standards"," open source. \\n 1. Oky is an open source software: anyone in the world can download the white-labelled version of the code. \\n 2. Oky complies with W3C standards. For instance"," both the website and the app follow the guidelines written under WAI"," as both are built to enable text to speech. In addition"," to comply with W3C privacy standards"," the Oky website does not use any cookies. Also"," as Oky is offered in multiple languages (English"," Bahasa"," Mongolian and some more to be coming too)"," it has been built to comply with the internalization principles. The app and website has been built in a way so it caters for different alphabets such as the Cyrillian"," Latin alphabet etc.","Finally"," to keep user\'s data safe"," Oky follows the standards set in Cyber Essentials. This includes encryption of data and penetration testing (amongst other methods) to ensure there are no vulnerabilities in the system and potential data leaks.

Understand the Existing Ecosystem \\n Dengue is already an existing public health problem not only in the Philippines and but also in many Asian and Latin American countries. As the product needs to be improved further"," we are working with other researchers and scoping for funding opportunities.","3. Design for Scale \\n We are now closely working with other researchers to further improve AEDES. We want to expand the functionalities of AEDES and incorporate a dengue risk index. We have used the MVC Framework (Model"," View"," Controller) which isolates application functionality into self-contained components. We also utilized the API from Sentinel Copernicus Satellites to  get satellite images with vast date ranges.","4. Build for Sustainability \\n Since the data captured is from global and public remote sensing service"," the application can continue gathering data. There is a plan to create a social enterprise around the dengue prediction service"," by incorporating other risk frameworks"," we can generalize the process and ensure that other indicators will also be integrated. The results and/or insights will be offered on a subscription basis.","5. Be Data Driven \\n Data"," as it moves along its value chain from creation to actionable insights"," underpins the overall workflow of AEDES. Also"," by leveraging the three main disciplines of analytics - Descriptive"," Predictive"," and Prescriptive"," AEDES facilitates a holistic approach to dengue prevention and control and empowers its intended users to make informed decisions.","6. Use Open Standards"," Open Data"," Open Source"," and Open Innovation \\n AEDES was built through an open innovation challenge by NASA"," we also advocate the use of Open Source technologies such as Python"," PHP for tools"," QGIS for geospatial analysis","  Sentinel Copernicus Satellites for data"," and government sources for weather and health-related data. AEDES prototype is also publicly hosted 24/7 for free. We welcome collaborators to improve and provide feedback to the AEDES implementation.","7. Reuse and Improve \\n AEDES at its core was developed by reusing prior work by other researchers. By combining three research papers related to using social listening"," stagnant water detection"," and dengue prediction we have developed the application. We are planning on using other research to integrate risk frameworks to improve the current workflow of AEDES.","8. Address Privacy & Security \\n We dont collect"," store"," or transfer any personal information. AEDES website also uses HTTPS (Positive SSL) for website security.","9.

RBAC prevents access leaks and, thereby, reduces the risk of data and information security breaches. \\n- Access to production data is password protected and user rights and permissions are defined during system configuration. Access to monitoring services that ingest service logs is restricted to technical support staff and is protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication.

Currently we live in a technological age where children and adolescents live a normality that consists of the use of technological tools. They get bored easily, the way in which information is presented to them is not very motivating and school is no longer the only means of access to education. There are different tools through which they can acquire knowledge, however the minimum has a pedagogical basis. Due to the aforementioned, we must innovate in the teaching-learning process. Currently there are new teaching methodologies, with a focus on active learning and the development of skills through play. One of these methodologies is gamification. Different authors define it as a process in which game mechanisms are used to attract people, promote learning and solve problems. The purpose is to motivate the player\'s behavior. Elements in the game such as points, avatars or levels, increase the psychological predisposition of the player to continue in it. This makes gamification an ally of education. Currently there are game developers who use platforms like Godot, however they do not have the pedagogical knowledge to add elements that help the user to consolidate their learning. That\'s why Pixframe Studios is developing a plugin for the Godot Engine: a tool to help new game developers and serious game teams create new games with the goal of aiding in the development of education. As mentioned before, Latin America is still trying to develop new tools to improve their educational field, nevertheless they don\'t have enough knowledge nor tools to achieve it. The plugin is open source so that the community in Latin America can access new ways of creating video games with a pedagogical basis. In this way, code is created, optimized and shared. Educational material can be shared in an innovative way and finally a stock of illustrative material is generated such as button icons, backgrounds for games, fonts and unique Godot Engine assets."}],"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Pixframe Studios","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot"}],"documentation":"https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot/blob/main/README.md,https://github.com/pixframeStudios/towi_godot/blob/main/How%20to%20use","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"openStandards":["GDScript basics standard","Open Source Initiative Open Standard Requirements https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/open-standards.html#requirements","https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html","https://opensource.org/licenses/category Use Open Standards","Open Source","Understand the Existing Ecosystem"],"dataPrivacySecurity":{"collectsPII":"PII data is collected and stored but NOT distributed.","typesOfPIIDataCollected":["TOWI may collect information from its SUBSCRIBERS"," through our Site"," of the following types:","- Personal Information such as: Full name"," date of birth"," age"," place of birth"," address"," telephone"," family data or references"," email"," occupation"," gender"," academic level"," university career"," work or professional experience"," interests"," country"," region or state.

In Burkina Faso for instance, 81 bi- and multilateral agencies are active. Each one has its own requirements, defines its own conditions and pursues its own goals. Burkina Faso must cope with all of the related demands. As a result, its ministries host over 300 different project teams. Acting on the initiative of the donors, these teams sometimes work at cross purposes in the same regions and sectors. TruBudget allows for the establishment of shared platforms that significantly expand donors\' scope for using a partner country\'s systems. If funds are no longer channeled past the partner country\'s government structures but out of government structures in the partner country, this strengthens the partner country\'s capacities and its ownership. Donor contributions from different donors can be used in a coordinated manner in line with the respective national development policy priorities. This can drastically reduce the major coordination and administrative workload for the partner countries.

Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.

Example layer included in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet.

UNBL contains several relevant layers associated with the SDG.  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for crops and flooded vegetation. Example: The Marine Priority Areas for Food Security layer identifies priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision and carbon storage.  Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03371-z  Example: the Crop Suitability Change layer shows general agricultural suitability considering rain-fed conditions and irrigation on currently irrigated areas.The dataset covers two time periods (2011-2040, 2071-2100), as well as changes in agricultural suitability over two periods (1981-2100, 2011-2100). Example layer in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL provides a number of layers related to water provision and essential watersheds.  Example: The Nature Map Realised Clean Water Provision layer consists of a globally normalized map (from 0 to 1) of pixels ranked for their relative importance in delivering clean water to downstream beneficiaries. Example: The City Water Map layer contains information on the water sources for 534 cities internationally. The watershed layer shown here includes information about the catchment area of the watershed that supplies these cities.  Example layer in link below.,&#013; &#010;Mapping urban areas, and trends in urban development is relevant here. At 10m scale users can also start to identify large green spaces in urban areas and agricultural peripheries. UNBL provides a number of layers related to this.  Example: The Global Grid of Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030 layer presents spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land cover change from 2000 to 2030 at a 2.5 arc-minute resolution. Citation: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211658109  Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). The map is derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. It is a composite of LULC predictions for 10 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of 2020. It includes classifications for Built Areas. Example in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL provides a number of layers that relate to carbon sequestration and climate change scenarios. Example: The Esri 2020 Land Cover 10m (IO) layer displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC). Land cover conversion plays a major role in CO2 emissions (e.g. deforestation and conversion of other natural habitats) as well as climate resilience (mapping forests, mangroves, etc, for nature-based climate solutions) Example: The Aboveground and Belowground Biomass Carbon layer provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300m spatial resolution. Example: The Global Soil Organic Carbon Organic Carbon Map (GSOC map) allows the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30cm. It also represents a key contribution to SDG indicator 15.3.1 which defines the area of degraded land.  Example: the UNBL Data Collection on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change offers further data layers that can be used to answer key policy questions related to nature-based solutions for climate change.  Example layer included in link below.,&#013; &#010;UNBL is most clearly connected to SDG15 with its wealth of biodiversity data.  Example: The Biodiversity Intactness Index shows the modeled average abundance of originally-present species in a grid cell, as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem. It can be seen as a measure of how much humans have impacted terrestrial biodiversity, or as a measure of how degraded biodiversity in an area is. Example: The Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII) layer identifies structurally complex forests with low human pressure that are likely to be most valuable for biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Example: The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) layer identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.  Example: The Threatened Species Richness layer represents the number of species of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and plant taxa whose distribution overlaps in each 10km cell. Example: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) layer is largest database of protected areas on the planet. The data are the legally defined protected area (PA) borders as reported by governments, for both marine and terrestrial areas. UNBL draws protected area data directly from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).

Approximately 20% of persons with social anxiety disorder reported declining a job offer or promotion due to social fears and primary care patients with social anxiety disorder reported significantly greater absenteeism and reduced productivity compared to patients without psychiatric problems.\\n\\n\\n"}],"categories":["Open Software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/Ideasis/VivoosVR"}],"clearOwnership":[{"clearOwnershipName":"Ideasis / Turkey","clearOwnershipURL":"https://github.com/Ideasis/VivoosVR/blob/master/LICENSE"}],"documentation":"https://github.com/Ideasis/VivoosVR/blob/master/README.md","NonPII":{"collectsNonPII":"No","nonPIIAccessMechanism":""},"openStandards":["All our content must be built in accordance with the proper techniques in relation with cognitive behavioural therapy.

Barriers to inclusion and participation are exacerbated by the lack of access to affordable, relevant assistive technology. According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in people with disabilities engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability. Digital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure \'no one is left behind\' in our increasingly digital world.

Preventing Errors:\\n - \\nE-Heza\'s decision logic model and all aspects of clinical care are governed by a clinical review process that includes physicians, healthcare workers, and digital health specialists. This work is reviewed by the E-Heza Executive committee. \\n- Development work is open source and follows a peer review process in which all code is first reviewed by another developer before it is submitted to the QA process. \\n- E-Heza adheres to best practices  privacy and data security standards to ensure the protection of private patient information. \\n2. Learning from mistakes: \\n- TIP Global Health\'s Model is based on gathering feedback and acting on it. There is a regular process of understanding challenges and potential errors which may cause harm. (https://tipglobalhealth.org/our-model/) \\n- The feedback process is governed by the E-Heza Executive committee and overseen by the TIP Global Health Steering Committee. \\n3. Promoting a culture of safety through safe practices and safe systems. \\n - E-Heza\u2019s training model is built to encourage co-design and encourages the foundational feedback mechanisms in order to understand both errors of omission and errors of commission. TIP  Global Health takes the following steps to ensure the privacy and security of data collected: \\n- Healthcare workers sign and commit to a \u201cProtected Health Information Confidentiality Agreement\u201d and receive initial and ongoing training regarding privacy and security. \\n - Access to E-Heza\u2019s backend (where private data is held) is secured with role-based permission access and only site administrators with proper need are given access to private data. \\n- Transfer of data between E-Heza\u2019s front-end client and backend storage is through SSL-encrypted channels only and performed only with authenticated devices. \\n- E-Heza maintains an access log which tracks all access and both to backend accounts and front end data collection. Weekly audits are performed on the access logs, and the  logs are maintained for one year (and then archived through the prescribed backup retention plan). \\n- E-Heza\u2019s development operation prohibits the use of non-anonymized data in the development process. No developer may hold personal information on their local system to transfer any personal information from a non-production environment outside the course of the normal backup procedure. \\n - E-Heza engages in third-party security audits in order to procure recommendations for further privacy and security procedures."},"userContent":{"contentManagement":"Content is NOT collected NOT stored and NOT distributed.","contentTypes":[],"contentManagementPolicy":""},"protectionFromHarassment":{"facilitatesUserInteraction":"Yes","harassmentPolicy":"E-Heza is designed to be used only by healthcare workers and implementing organizations are responsible for screening healthcare workers for age.
