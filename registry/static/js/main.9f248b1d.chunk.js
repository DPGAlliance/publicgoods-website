When monitoring a public facility, the owner of the facility is present, and the project team immediately notifies him or her of which elements of the facility do not meet the standards for accessibility of facilities open to the public. On the portal \u201cAccessible Kazakhstan\u201d one can find checklists with criteria for assessing accessibility of facilities, so that, if desired, the owners can read them and afterwards be involved in monitoring independently. Upon request, the project team develops recommendations, on the basis of which owners and government agencies start working on the adaptation of particular facilities for the aforementioned categories of citizens. Based on current data on accessibility of public facilities, comprehensive policies and plans for inclusion can be adopted and implemented. This, in turn, will reduce inequalities and accelerate achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals that affect development of an inclusive society. The world community needs qualified specialists who are able to form a barrier-free environment. It is for the purpose of training such specialists in 2019 within the framework of the \u201cAccessible Kazakhstan\u201d project that a unique online course \u201cEnsuring accessibility of a public facility\u201d was developed.

Our airships benefit from combining the lifting power of helium with advanced flight control and power train technologies to offer order-of-magnitude advantages over multi-copter and fixed-wing platforms. Indeed, when compared with UAVs currently being used for logistics, airships are safer (and therefore preferred by regulators), less expensive, more flexible, have a greater range and much greater carrying capacity.  Our South African engineering team is determined to solve core problems at home. The team has been privileged enough to know what seamless logistics looks like in a developed setting, while being close enough to places where that same access is near non-existent.

For instance, the law mandates a 5% reservation for the disabled in India, but educational institutions are often at a loss in delivering inclusive education services, forcing students to rely on volunteers and often dropping out. Similarly, reasonable accommodations are still in their infancy at corporates throughout the country. Specifically, for people with print disabilities, this leads to much of the content (e.g. textbooks, handouts etc.) as well as over 97.4% of webpages remaining inaccessible due to it being incompatible with assistive technologies. Covid-19 has further exacerbated this challenge with social distancing leading to lack of volunteers and online education leading to a proliferation in the creation and sharing of inaccessible digital content. Thus, I-Stem, through our work in document accessibility seeks to end this \\"book famine\\", thereby promoting independence and self-reliance in education for all.","evidenceURL":"https://www.unicef.org/innovation/innovation-fund-i-stem"},{"SDGNumber":10,"evidenceText":"In our research over the last two years and in talking to hundreds of users and organizations in India and beyond, there are three critical aspects that organizations request when starting on their inclusion journey-accessible websites/apps and other digital portals, content accessibility services for their students/employees/users with disabilities and upskilling/training. This project is the first step in this direction in being able to provide organizations and people with disabilities the tools they need to convert any inaccessible content into accessible format (including complex content such as math, multi-column layouts, tables etc.). This not only helps people with disabilities access content in a reliable and efficient manner but also substantially saves time, effort and money (by upto 70%) spent by organizations to remediate content.

To further reduce this supply-demand gap, the platform facilitates the industries to advertise job vacancies to specific audience, receive skilled youth, and maintain a supply-demand relationship with skills providers to simplify information sharing amongst them on emerging job opportunities, skilled HR, and market driven skills. Thus, NISE is essentially making impacts in economic development by preparing a demand driven skilled workforce. Youths equipped with proper skills will ultimately be able to secure decent and gainful employment not only in own country but also in abroad by ensuring skilled and safe migration and get equal pay as per their skillsets."},{"SDGNumber":17,"evidenceText":"Youth unemployment is a global challenge, posing newer threats in the post COVID reality.

NISE has already been replicated in Somalia and Jordan to solve similar problem in these countries.

Barriers to inclusion and participation are exacerbated by the lack of access to affordable, relevant assistive technology. According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in people with disabilities engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability. Digital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure \'no one is left behind\' in our increasingly digital world.

By digitizing the 230 form, we have eliminated the need for direct contact between NGOs and their supporters, as many organizations do not have the necessary resources to gather these forms offline.","evidenceURL":"https://www.concordia.org.ro/ajuta-si-tu/redirectioneaza-35/"}],"sectors":[],"type":["software"],"repositories":[{"name":"main","url":"https://github.com/code4romania/redirectioneaza"}],"organizations":[{"name":"Code for Romania NGO","website":"https://code4.ro/","org_type":"owner","contact_name":"Code for Romania","contact_email":"contact@code4.ro"}],"stage":"nominee","githubActivity":"<a href=\\"https://github.com/code4romania/redirectioneaza\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\n          \\n  <span class=\\"tooltipped tooltipped-s\\" aria-label=\\"Past year of activity\\">\\n    <svg width=\\"155\\" height=\\"30\\">\\n      <defs>\\n        <linearGradient id=\\"gradient-125417219\\" x1=\\"0\\" x2=\\"0\\" y1=\\"1\\" y2=\\"0\\">\\n          <stop offset=\\"0%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L1-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"10%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L2-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"25%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L3-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"50%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L4-bg)\\"></stop>\\n        </linearGradient>\\n        <mask id=\\"sparkline-125417219\\" x=\\"0\\" y=\\"0\\" width=\\"155\\" height=\\"28\\">\\n          <polyline transform=\\"translate(0, 28) scale(1,-1)\\" points=\\"0,1 3,1 6,1 9,2 12,1 15,1 18,1 21,1 24,1 27,1 30,1 33,1 36,1 39,1 42,1 45,1 48,1 51,3 54,1 57,1 60,1 63,1 66,1 69,1 72,1 75,1 78,1 81,1 84,4 87,11 90,20 93,8 96,6 99,4 102,5 105,1 108,1 111,1 114,3 117,1 120,5 123,2 126,2 129,4 132,3 135,11 138,5 141,6 144,2 147,1 150,1 153,1 \\" fill=\\"transparent\\" stroke=\\"#8cc665\\" stroke-width=\\"2\\">\\n        </polyline></mask>\\n      </defs>\\n\\n      <g transform=\\"translate(0, -3)\\">\\n        <rect x=\\"0\\" y=\\"-2\\" width=\\"155\\" height=\\"30\\" style=\\"stroke: none; fill: url(#gradient-125417219); mask: url(#sparkline-125417219)\\"></rect>\\n      </g>\\n    </svg>\\n  </span>\\n</a>","dpgLink":false},{"name":"Reveal","aliases":[""],"description":"Reveal is a Digital Global Good that uses spatial intelligence to drive delivery of life-saving interventions.","website":"https://revealprecision.com/","license":[{"spdx":"Apache-2.0","licenseURL":"https://github.com/akrosinc/reveal-server/blob/main/LICENSE"}],"SDGs":[{"SDGNumber":1,"evidenceText":"Reveal supports microplanning and mobilization of resources, including basic social services, financial aid, or food aid.

In Burkina Faso for instance, 81 bi- and multilateral agencies are active. Each one has its own requirements, defines its own conditions and pursues its own goals. Burkina Faso must cope with all of the related demands. As a result, its ministries host over 300 different project teams. Acting on the initiative of the donors, these teams sometimes work at cross purposes in the same regions and sectors. TruBudget allows for the establishment of shared platforms that significantly expand donors\' scope for using a partner country\'s systems. If funds are no longer channeled past the partner country\'s government structures but out of government structures in the partner country, this strengthens the partner country\'s capacities and its ownership.

Especially people living in conflict areas and/or developing or underdeveloped areas are more likely to experience severe mental disorders. Lack of availability of quality mental health care is another problem for above mentioned regions. Globally, 75% of people with mental health conditions remain untreated. \\nPandemic related anxiety is another rapidly rising problem. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is drastically changing the way of life. Workplaces, schools, universities have closed. Socializing with friends and family is highly discouraged. These circumstances have a significant negative effect on our social, physical and mental wellbeing. As, Dr Brock Chisholm, the first Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), stated ?without mental health there can be no true physical health.\\n Our solution targets to: \\n?\\tImprove mental health care, provide a quicker, safer and more cost effective way to deal with anxiety.\\n?\\tHelp reduce the global suicide rate, providing that depression is one of the major causes of suicide, which is in comorbidity with anxiety disorders.\\n?\\tDecrease the burden on the social security systems, by reducing therapy costs and time while contributing to the effectiveness of the treatments.\\n?\\tProvide an opportunity for low income and displaced individuals to receive mental health treatment, due to the ease of use with reduced cost and time, more people can get treatment during the same time / cost provided.\\n\\nIndirect impacts\\nSDG 1: No Poverty\\nSDG 2: Zero Hunger\\nSDG 4: Quality Education\\nSDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth\\nResearch has shown that people with anxiety have higher unemployment rates and are more likely to settle for lower incomes.\\nFive of the 10 leading causes of disability worldwide are mental problems (major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, alcohol use and obsessive-compulsive disorders). These disorders ? together with anxiety, depression and stress ? have a definitive impact on any working population and should be addressed within that context.

Zamba uses state-of-the-art computer vision and artificial intelligence to perform intensive camera trap video processing work, freeing up more time for humans to focus on interpreting the content and using the results.","evidenceURL":"https://zamba.drivendata.org/"}],"sectors":["Environment"],"type":["aimodel","software"],"repositories":[{"name":"Zamba","url":"https://github.com/drivendataorg/zamba"}],"organizations":[{"name":"DrivenData","website":"https://www.drivendata.co/","org_type":"maintainer"}],"stage":"DPG","githubActivity":"<a href=\\"https://github.com/drivendataorg/zamba\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\n          \\n  <span class=\\"tooltipped tooltipped-s\\" aria-label=\\"Past year of activity\\">\\n    <svg width=\\"155\\" height=\\"30\\">\\n      <defs>\\n        <linearGradient id=\\"gradient-124150639\\" x1=\\"0\\" x2=\\"0\\" y1=\\"1\\" y2=\\"0\\">\\n          <stop offset=\\"0%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L1-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"10%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L2-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"25%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L3-bg)\\"></stop>\\n          <stop offset=\\"50%\\" stop-color=\\"var(--color-calendar-graph-day-L4-bg)\\"></stop>\\n        </linearGradient>\\n        <mask id=\\"sparkline-124150639\\" x=\\"0\\" y=\\"0\\" width=\\"155\\" height=\\"28\\">\\n          <polyline transform=\\"translate(0, 28) scale(1,-1)\\" points=\\"0,2 3,1 6,1 9,1 12,1 15,1 18,1 21,1 24,1 27,1 30,1 33,1 36,1 39,1 42,1 45,1 48,1 51,5 54,4 57,3 60,1 63,1 66,1 69,1 72,3 75,3 78,1 81,1 84,1 87,1 90,1 93,5 96,1 99,1 102,1 105,2 108,1 111,1 114,2 117,1 120,1 123,2 126,1 129,1 132,1 135,4 138,1 141,1 144,2 147,1 150,2 153,4 \\" fill=\\"transparent\\" stroke=\\"#8cc665\\" stroke-width=\\"2\\">\\n        </polyline></mask>\\n      </defs>\\n\\n      <g transform=\\"translate(0, -10)\\">\\n        <rect x=\\"0\\" y=\\"-2\\" width=\\"155\\" height=\\"30\\" style=\\"stroke: none; fill: url(#gradient-124150639); mask: url(#sparkline-124150639)\\"></rect>\\n      </g>\\n    </svg>\\n  </span>\\n</a>","dpgLink":true}]')}},[[14,1,2]]]);
