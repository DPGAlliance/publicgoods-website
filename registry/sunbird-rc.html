		<h2>Sunbird RC</h2>
			<p>An open source software to rapidly build and deploy next generation electronic registries and verifiable credentials including attestation and verification flows. Electronic registres are trusted systems that enables consented actors (who are in the registry) to enroll and avail 3rd party services built on top of it using registry APIs. Sunbird RC can be used to build various registries of people, things, entries for across domains (hospital registry, teacher registry, vehicle registry, credential registry, etc) at country scale.   Adopters can rapidly build core electronic registries through configurable schemas and workflows. Software automatically created necessary APIs, workflows, and a default UX for all key stakeholders of the registry. In addition, adopters can use Sunbird RC to implement digital credentialing based on W3C Verifiable Credential specifications.</p>

Sunbird RC, as a generalized building block, is used to create The Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination Open Credentialing (DIVOC) solution to support countries with their vaccination effort. DIVOC builds on top of  Sunbird RC to digitize the generation of a vaccination certificate available both in electronic form and printable copy downloaded from the central vaccination database.

Registries should leverage other existing registries, avoid creating multiple sources of truths,  and allowing other federated linked registries to be built on top.</li><li>Accountability &amp; Non-repudiability. Complexity is an inherent characteristic of large-scale ecosystems, and solutions can not be trusted and sustained if the authenticity of authorship and validity of contracts can be repudiated. Registry will enable non-repudiation of authorship and contracts as an embedded feature using user authentication and digital signatures.</li><li>Empowerment &amp; Self-maintainability. Empowering data owners, by giving them the ability to view, initiate correction and control how their information is accessed or used, by giving them the ability to give and withdraw consent at the attribute level (consent-based architecture).</li><li>Security &amp; Consented Access. Ensuring that data is exchanged in a secured manner with well defined privacy rules and in alignment with access allowed by data owner and issuer.</li><li>Universal Access &amp; Open APIs. Universal Access &amp; Open APIs</li><li>Registries based on these principles will drive data accuracy and build trust in the system among the actors of the ecosystem.</li><li>Reference: <a href="https://docs.sunbirdrc.dev/learn/design-principles" target="_blank">https://docs.sunbirdrc.dev/learn/design-principles</a></li></ul></div><p><b>9.
