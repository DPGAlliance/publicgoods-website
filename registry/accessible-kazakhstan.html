		<li><b>11. Sustainable Cities and Communities</b><p><span style="color:grey; font-weight:bold">Evidence:</span> The 'Accessible Kazakhstan' map reflects the needs of those who particularly seek accessible, safe and comfortable public space, including people with disabilities, parents with small children in prams, the elderly, pregnant women, temporarily injured people and children under seven years old.  When monitoring a public facility, the owner of the facility is present, and the project team immediately notifies him or her of which elements of the facility do not meet the standards for accessibility of facilities open to the public. On the portal “Accessible Kazakhstan” one can find checklists with criteria for assessing accessibility of facilities, so that, if desired, the owners can read them and afterwards be involved in monitoring independently. Upon request, the project team develops recommendations, on the basis of which owners and government agencies start working on the adaptation of particular facilities for the aforementioned categories of citizens. Based on current data on accessibility of public facilities, comprehensive policies and plans for inclusion can be adopted and implemented. This, in turn, will reduce inequalities and accelerate achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals that affect development of an inclusive society. The world community needs qualified specialists who are able to form a barrier-free environment. It is for the purpose of training such specialists in 2019 within the framework of the “Accessible Kazakhstan” project that a unique online course “Ensuring accessibility of a public facility” was developed. The course: helps to get acquainted with legislation governing the provision of access to public facilities for people with disabilities and other population groups with limited mobility; can be used to find out what criteria accessibility of public facilities and open spaces is evaluated by; explains how to protect one’s right to a barrier-free environment; teaches how to monitor a public facility and develop recommendations for its adaptation to the needs of people with disabilities.</p><p><span style="color:grey; font-weight:bold">Link to Evidence:</span> <a href="https://cabar.asia/en/how-accessible-is-kazakhstan-for-people-with-disabilities" target="_blank">https://cabar.asia/en/how-accessible-is-kazakhstan-for-people-with-disabilities</a></p></li></ul>

We ensure confidentiality of user personal data by complying with the requirement to prevent their dissemination without the user’s consent or another legal basis. Additionally, the administrator revises the privacy policy on a monthly basis and, if necessary, supplements it. To prevent unauthorized access to data, we take legal and technical measures to protect the information system.  Legal measures include an agreement on the confidentiality of personal data concluded by the owner of the information system, which establishes the conditions for work, access and use of personal data, as well as responsibility for their violation. Technical measures include the use of information security tools: An SSL certificate is connected to our website. It guarantees a secure connection between the user's browser and the server. When using the SSL protocol, information is transmitted in encrypted form via HTTPS and can only be decrypted using a special key, unlike the usual HTTP protocol. For authorization via social networks, the OAuth2 standard is used as a special means of protecting accounts. Access right: this includes assignment of the roles for “administrator” and “user” and the ability to gain access to the users’ personal data only by logging into the system using the password for the administrator account.</li><li>The privacy policy: <a href="https://doskaz.kz/privacy_policy.pdf" target="_blank">https://doskaz.kz/privacy_policy.pdf</a></li><li>The terms of service: <a href="https://doskaz.kz/terms-of-service.pdf" target="_blank">https://doskaz.kz/terms-of-service.pdf</a></li><li>The agreement on the confidentiality of personal data: <a href="https://doskaz.kz/privacy_agreement.pdf" target="_blank">https://doskaz.kz/privacy_agreement.pdf</a> </li></ul></div><p><b>8.

This is reflected in the fact that the project served as an innovative solution for people with disabilities: there were no such maps in the country before, and now the population has an opportunity to independently evaluate how accessible a particular facility is and add it to the map. It is also worth noting the unique online course available on the website, which acts as a practical tool for creating and developing safe and comfortable settlements. The project proved its sustainability in the long term: it was originally made for only one city, and then expanded and grew into a map for the whole republic. The next step is obtaining a status of Digital Public Good as a pathfinding pilot project run by UNICEF in Kazakhstan. As a potential future direction of development, we consider using artificial intelligence in the information system. In addition to cooperation with UNICEF, close interaction with site users and recipients of the benefits should be noted: the ability to supplement and amend the map is open to all registered users. Thus, the project encourages the activity of civil society and increases the level of individual responsibility for accessible, safe and comfortable public space. We take into account suggestions from users to improve the map (regarding the interface, new additional functions and sections on the site, etc.). A version of the website for people with low vision is also available.</li></ul></div><p><b>9. Does the project do no harm by design?</b></p><div style="padding-left:30px"><p><b>Has this project taken steps to anticipate, prevent and do no harm by design?</b></p><div style="padding-left:60px"><p><b>On the whole, does this project take steps to ensure that it anticipates, prevents and does no harm by design?</b></p><p>Yes</p><p><b>Is there any additional information you would like to share about the mechanisms, processes or policies that this project uses to avoid doing harm by design?</b></p><p>- Demonstrating the level of accessibility of public facilities, one should take into account that, for example, a person in a wheelchair can not enter a cafe without a ramp, but a person with low vision can. In order to personalize the map for each user, we collect data related to the health conditions of users. Such data is considered particularly sensitive and therefore requires additional protection. To prevent unauthorized access, we use the technical and legal means of data protection described in sections 7 and 9a. <br>- We also strive to ensure that the information posted on the website is accurate and up-to-date, whether it is a description of accessibility of facilities, or published normative legal acts regarding creation of a barrier-free environment. However, we understand that there is a risk of misinformation due to the fact that occasionally legal acts are amended, and public facilities may eventually be rebuilt, closed or renovated. <br> -In this regard, firstly, the administrator of the website monitors the legislation for changes once a month and, if necessary, updates the normative legal acts on the portal of 'Accessible Kazakhstan'. <br>- Secondly, we have provided for users a function “Confirm data about facility”. If the state of a facility does not match its description on our platform, users can leave feedback and indicate what the discrepancy is. After the administrator gets acquainted with the provided information about the state of the facility, compares the description of accessibility with the provided photos and/ or videos, the updated and / or supplemented version of the facility card will appear in the system. Users can also confirm the description of the facility if they believe that all the information about it is filled in correctly. <br> -Thirdly, disclaimers can be found on the platform that we do not give any guarantee regarding the accuracy of information about facilities displayed on the map and we are not responsible for this. We also warn users that normative legal acts are often edited, and we ask the users to check whether the acts remain valid by means of searching them on the information and legal system of normative legal acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan “Adilet” or in the information system “PARAGRAPH”.</p></div><p><b>9.a.
