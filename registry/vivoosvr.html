Stable frame rates are a must for VR experiences. Our simulations have been optimized to run at a stable frame per second on a variety of hardware. Artificial camera movements can have a negative impact on the comfort level of a VR experience. For this reason, we have implemented a teleportation based locomotion system and refrained from using any artificial camera movements which could induce motion sickness.</li><li>On the other hand, our simulation scenarious have been developed in collaboration with universities and clinicians specializing in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Therefore, the exposure methodoly that our simulations are based on is in accordance with the best practicies in the field of mental health.
